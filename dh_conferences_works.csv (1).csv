In this panel, members of the Interface Design team of the Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE) project will present a set of ideas, designs, and prototypes related to the next generation of the online scholarly edition, by which we mean a primary text and its scholarly apparatus, intended for use by people studying a text.
We begin with ‘Digital Scholarly Editions: An Evolutionary Perspective’, which proposes a taxonomy of design features and functions available in a wide range of existing projects involving scholarly editions. ‘Implementing Text Analysis E-reader Tools to Create Ad-hoc Scholarly Editions’ draws on this taxonomy and examines how the strategies of ubiquitous text analysis can be applied to digital texts as a means of providing new affordances for scholarship. ‘Visualizing Citation Patterns in Humanist Scholarship’ looks at the use of citations in scholarly writing and proposes visual models of possible benefit for both writers and readers. ‘The Dynamic Table of Contexts: User Experience and Future Directions’ reports our pilot study of a tool that combines the conventional table of contents with semantic XML encoding to produce a rich-prospect browser for books, while ‘The Usability of Bubblelines: A Comparative Evaluation of Two Prototypes’ provides our results in looking at a case where two distinct prototypes of a visualization tool for comparative search results were created from a single design concept.
digital scholarly editions: a functional perspective

Definitions of the scholarly edition at times seem as diverse as their content; definitions may highlight usefulness (e.g., Hjørland, n.d.), reliability (e.g. Lyman, 2009), or editorial expertise (e.g. Price 2008). Nevertheless, it is clear that scholarly editions ‘comprise the most fundamental tools in literary studies’ (McGann 2001: 55). The move from print to screen has offered scholars an opportunity to remediate scholarly editions and to improve upon them (Werstine 2008; Shillingsburg 2006), perhaps in the hope of producing their ‘fullest realization’ (Lyman 2009: iii).
Online, distinctions between traditional types of scholarly editions are blurred. Variorum editions are increasingly becoming the norm (Galey 2007), since the economy of space is no longer as important a variable. The notion of a ‘best version’ of a text is also becoming less of an issue, as what constitutes ‘the best’ is open to interpretation and is often irrelevant with regard to questions that scholars would like to ask (Price 2008).
Rather than categorizing electronic scholarly editions, we propose to evaluate a selection of influential and/or representative examples on the basis of a series of functional areas that have been noted in relevant literature as having undergone substantial changes in their move to the digital environment. These areas include (1) navigation, including browsing and searching; (2) knowledge-sharing, including public annotation; (3) textual analysis, including graphs and visualizations; (4) customizability of both interface and content; (5) side-by-side comparisons of multiple versions; and (6) private note-taking and markup.
This study reveals that although all of the functionalities available in the digital medium are not implemented in every digital scholarly edition, it is nevertheless the case that even the simplest amongst them offer affordances that are different than their printed counterparts. The fact remains, however, that due to variety of functionalities implemented in digital scholarly editions, we are still negotiating what Lyman’s ‘fullest realization’ could be.

With the proliferation of e-readers, the digitization efforts of organizations such as Google and Project Gutenberg, and the explosion of e-book sales, digital reading has become a commonplace activity. Although resources for casual reading are plentiful, they are insufficient to support in-depth scholarly research.
To alleviate this difficulty, we propose integrating Voyant tools, a user-friendly, flexible and powerful web-based text analysis environment developed by Stéfan Sinclair and Geoffrey Rockwell, with current e-reader technology, such as that used in the Internet Archive reader.
In this design, Voyant functions as a sidebar to e-readers, allowing the text to remain visible during analysis. Choosing from a list of tools allows scholars to create a custom text analysis tool palette and having more than one tool open allows cross-referencing between results. Tools can be dragged into a custom order and a scroll bar allows navigation between several tools at once. A Voyant tutorial is available and each individual tool also has its own instructions for use, as well as a help feature and an option to export results.
We anticipate this tool being of use to scholars in various fields who wish to use quantitative methods to analyze text. By implementing tools for textual analysis in an online reading environment, we are in effect offering scholars the ability to choose the kinds of analysis and depth of study that they wish; they will in effect be able to produce ad-hoc customized editions of digital text.

This paper documents the design and programming of a visualization tool for the analysis of citation patterns in extended humanist works such as monographs and scholarly editions. Traditional citation analysis is widely acknowledged as being ineffective for examining citations in the humanities, since the accretive nature of research (Garfield 1980), the existence of multiple paradigms, the preference for monographs (Thompson 2002), and the richness of non-parenthetical citations all present problems for interpretation and generalization.
To address this situation, we employ non-traditional methods of content and context analysis of citations, like functional classification (Frost 1979) and the exploration of the way in which sources are introduced in the flow of the argument (Hyland 1999). Acknowledging the richness of citations in humanist research, we employ graphic visualization for display and data inquiry, which allows us to carry out visual analytical tasks of the referencing patterns of full monographs.
We opted to provide three distinct views of the analyzed monograph. The first one – a faceted browser of the references, affords the comparison of different aspects of the references included and introduces the user to the structure and content of the monograph’s critical apparatus. The second view contextualizes individual citations and highlights the fragments of text they support (see Figure 2); by representing both supported and non-supported portions of the monograph in their natural order, the view facilitates the linear reading of the way in which argument is built in the citing work. Finally, the third view of the visualization tool represents the internal structure of complex footnotes (see Figure 3) and visually highlights the relationship between different citations included in the same note, as well as their function in relation to the argument of the citing text.
In this presentation we will introduce the visualization tool, demonstrate its functionalities and provide the results of initial testing performed. We will also discuss the lessons learned from this early stage of the project.

The Dynamic Table of Contexts (DToC) is a text analysis tool that combines the traditional concepts of the table of contents and index to create a new way to manipulate digital texts. More specifically, DToC makes use of pre-existing XML tags in a document to allow users to dynamically incorporate links to additional categories of items into the table of contents. Users may load documents they have tagged themselves, further increasing the interactivity and usefulness of the tool (Ruecker et al. 2009).
DToC includes four interactive panes, and one larger pane to view the text (see Figure 4). The first two panes are the table of contexts and the XML tag list: the former changes when a particular tag is selected in the latter, allowing the user to see where tokens of the tag fall in the sequence of the text. The third and fourth panes operate independently of each other but with the text itself: the ‘Excerpts’ pane highlights a selected token in the text and returns surrounding words, while the ‘Bubbleline’ maps multiple instances of a token across a pre-designated section (such as a chapter, or scene).
 
Figure 4: The Dynamic Table of Contexts, showing three of four interactive panes at left along with the text viewing pane at right.
With twelve pairs of participants (n = 24), we completed a user experience study in which the participants were invited: 1) to complete in pairs a number of tasks in DToC, 2) to respond individually to a computer-based survey about their experience, and 3) to provide more extensive feedback during an exit interview. Their actions and discussion while working with the prototype were recorded. Data analysis is presently underway: transcribed interview data has been encoded for features of experience in XML; screen captures are supplementing our understanding of the participants’ experience. In this paper we will report results and discuss future directions for development of the prototype.

In this paper, we explore the idea that programming is itself an act of interpretation, where the user experience can be profoundly influenced by seemingly minor details in the translation of a visual design into a prototype. We argue that the approach of doing two parallel, independent implementations can bring the trade-offs and design decisions into sharper relief to guide future development work. As a case study, we examine the results of the comparative user evaluation of two INKE prototypes for the bubblelines visualization tool. Bubblelines allows users to visually compare search results across multiple text files, such as novels, or pieces of text files, such as chapters. In this case, we had a somewhat rare opportunity in that both implementations of bubblelines began from a single design sketch, and the two development teams worked independently to produce online prototypes. The user experience study involved 12 participants, consisting of sophisticated computer users either working on or already having completed computer science degrees with a focus on human-computer interaction. They were given a brief introduction, exploratory period, assigned tasks, and an exit interview. The study focused on three design aspects: the visual representation, functionality and interaction.
All users liked the idea of bubblelines as a tool for exploring text search results. Some users wanted to use the tools to search and make sense of their own work, e.g. research papers and computer programming codes. The study has shown that there was no general preference for one prototype over the other. There was however, general agreements of preferred visual cues and functionalities that users found useful from both prototypes. Similarly, there was an overall consensus in relation to visual representations and functionalities that users found difficult to use and understand in both tools. Having the ability to compare two similar yet somehow different prototypes has assisted us in fishing out user requirements summarized in the form of visual cues, functionalities and interactive experiences from a dimension that that would have been difficult to reach if we were testing a single prototype.
 
Figure 5: The two alternative implementations of Bubblelines (t1 & t2)
In summary, most participants preferred the visual appearance and simplicity of t1, but the greater functionality offered by t2. Apparently incidental design decisions such as whether or not search was case sensitive, and whether strings or words were the objects of search (e.g. whether a search for ‘love’ would highlight ‘lover’ or ‘Love’ as well as ‘love’) often caused frustration or confusion. We argue that the approach of doing two parallel, independent implementations can bring the trade-offs and design decisions into sharper relief to guide future development work.
Our plan is to take these requirements into account in order to generate a third prototype which we envision to evaluate with expert users where our focus would be on the ability of the tool in assisting experts in making sense of the data.

We’re 14 years old now, a venerable age in this medium, like everything else somewhere between coming into being and going out of it, ‘like the swift flight of a single sparrow through the banqueting-hall where you are sitting at dinner on a winter’s day with your thegns and counsellors. In the midst there is a comforting fire to warm the hall; outside, the storms of winter rain or snow are raging. This sparrow flies swiftly in through one door of the hall and out through another. While he is inside, he is safe from the winter storms; but after a few moments of comfort, he vanishes from sight into the wintry world from which he came.’1

HUMANIST has been one of the few stable discussion spaces where people in the digital humanities can discuss the field. The metaphor of the swallow flying though the banqueting-hall captures what we would like our commons to be, warm and comfortable compared to the winter outside, and a feast of methods, ideas, and conversation. This paper will fly though the hall of HUMANIST on the wings of analytical methods. Specifically this paper will take a retrospective look at the evolution of the digital humanities through an analysis of HUMANIST using Voyant, a suite of web text tools we have developed for handling large corpora like this. In the paper we will therefore,

Ask why we might look at our history now?
Discuss the data analyzed and the methods used
Discuss the shift from humanities computing to the digital humanities
Look at the effect of the web on the field
why look back now?
In the space of a very few years the digital humanities seems to have gone from a marginal field trying to gain respect to a favorite of many university administrators. Digital humanists now need to define (and justify) what the digital humanities is to people who ask us – instead of trying to explain it to anyone willing to listen. It is difficult to pin down exactly when this transition happened, but one important moment was when William Pannapacker wrote in the Chronicle that ‘Amid all the doom and gloom of the 2009 MLA Convention, one field seems to be alive and well: the digital humanities.’ He continued with ‘the digital humanities seem like the first “next big thing” in a long time’.2 As John Unsworth noted in his ‘State of the Digital Humanties, 2010’ address to the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI), when a field is perceived to have jobs (while other humanities fields are seeing a dramatic decline) ‘it’s bound to attract some notice, especially among bright, goal-oriented graduate students who are approaching the job market.’3 As universities try to get into the game by posting not jobs but clusters of jobs, and graduate students try to adapt to those jobs, issues of definition and self-definition became important.

Alternatively this self-conscious turn could be due to funding agencies noticing and creating programs for the digital humanities like the Image, Text, Sound and Technology program of SSHRC that first made awards in 2003-4 and the Office of Digital Humanities programs of the US National Endowment for the Humanities. We shouldn’t underestimate the degree to which funding programs can get attention.

The self-conscious turn can also be seen in papers looking at the field and asking about it. Some examples include a paper by Wang and Inaba presented in Taipei and then published under the title, ‘Analyzing Structures and Evolution of Digital Humanities Based on Correspondence Analysis and Co-word Analysis.’4 Another is by Patrik Svensson titled ‘The Landscape of Digital Humanities.’5 Both essays provide a ‘birds-eye’ view of the field, though in very different ways. Wang and Inaba use text analysis and text mining techniques to ask about the shift from ‘humanities computing’ to ‘digital humanities’; Svensson takes a cultural studies approach looking at the actors and discourse.

data and methods
Like Wang and Inaba our method is to use DH methods like correspondence analysis, but we analyzed a different, messier and fuller text, the archives of the HUMANIST listserv. HUMANIST is a discussion list that was started by Willard McCarty when he was at the Centre for Computing in the Humanities at the University of Toronto in 1987. The first message introducing the list started with, ‘HUMANIST is a Bitnet/NetNorth electronic mail network for people who support computing in the humanities.’6 The list is still running, and, except for an interlude of a few years, is still moderated by Willard. HUMANIST has limitations that will be discussed in the full paper, but it provides a rich text for understanding the field in the English-speaking world.

Voyant, formerly called Voyeur, is a suite of text analysis tools that can be used individually or combined into ‘skins’ on texts that you upload or link to.7 Voyant is a second generation of web analytical tools that benefited from lessons learned by HyperPo and TAPoR. Our first generation of tools could only handle smaller texts (up to about 500K or the equivalent of a book or two) and therefore weren’t suitable for the study of large corpora. These tools were also developed as close (re)reading tools in a context of literary study of a single text or small corpus. In this project we adapted Voyant to handle the sort of corpus that allows us to do diachronic analysis and distant reading; we added mining tools that facilitate the formation and validation of hypotheses.

Part of our methodological practice is to develop a series of hypotheses about the last 25 years of Humanist. These are then tested, adapting and adding features to Voyant as needed. The tool development is thus deeply integrated with the analytical process. We will use the hypotheses and unexpected themes to discuss our flight through the corpus.

from humanities computing to digital humanities
We started with the expectation that there had been a shift from ‘humanities computing’ to ‘digital humanities’ as discussed by Wang and Inaba. While we certainly found ‘digital humanities’ taking off in 2004-5, we were surprised that ‘humanities computing’ continues to be a popular phrase. What is harder to do is to pinpoint why the term started to be used. One of the limitations of a public list is that it is suitable for epidemiological studies that tell you what happened and what correlated with what happened, but it is harder to tell what motivated people to change how they named the field.

Figure 1
Figure 1: Digital humanities and humanities computing

the passing of centers
A second hypothesis we started with was that the 1980s and 1990s had been a time of centers that made computing available in labs, but that the field had moved on to a more distributed project model. We did not find evidence for this. While the word project becomes more popular and it is true that some centres has closed, we found others had started up. Perhaps our particular experience with certain centers closing biased us into thinking this was a larger phenomenon.

the turn of the web
The most dramatic evidence of change was so obvious that we didn’t think about it or hypothesize it until we developed a tool that could show clusters of years and keywords using correspondence analysis.

Figure 2
Figure 2: Scatter plot from correspondence analysis

The scatterplot display of the major dimensions generated showed a strong pull of patterns like ‘web’, ‘www’, and ‘html.’ There seem to be three phases in the data studied:

1987-95: a phase when humanities computing is interested in computers, software, hardware, texts, and English.
1996-2000: a transitional period which may be an artifact of the corpus.
2001-present: a shift to digital web services and collaborative projects.
Figure 3
Figure 3: Net, web and internet

We believe the use of the web by humanists in the mid 1990s was a transformative for the field and may explain why less and less of our discussion was about hardware and software.

Figure 4
Figure 4: Software, services and hardware

As computers became ubiquitous in the 1970s and 1980s, humanities computing was concerned with supporting the new hardware and software. HUMANIST itself was initially conceived as a discussion list for those who supported others. Many humanists in 1986 were just beginning to use computers for word-processing and most didn’t have email. With the web as a canvas for digital projects we started to pay less attention to ‘processing’ and more to ‘methods.’ We began to make our own tools after the hard work of developing scholarly electronic texts. Above all we returned to ‘content’ going beyond text to look at other ‘media’ and the ‘social.’

Figure 5
Figure 5: Social, media and content

conclusion
The new-found traction of the digital humanities in academia is an opportunity to reflect on how the discipline has evolved and what it has become. Our contribution here is twofold: 1) a reading of HUMANIST that can help understand who we are and 2) a presentation of text analysis in practice. Of course, this is just our fly-through the corpus; with accessible web archives and tools like Voyant, the hall is open.

What would it mean to turn a class of undergraduates – one of the most important emerging digital humanities communities – loose on a text analysis puzzle unintentionally created by England’s poet laureate? This poster presentation will report on the process, outcomes, successes, and failures of an original research project for those just learning about the possibilities of humanities computing.

Carol Ann Duffy was named the poet laureate of Britain in May 2009, the first Scot, woman, and openly gay person to hold this position. While this choice signaled a desire for diversity and inclusiveness on the part of the crown, the most important criterion for her selection was her poetry itself. Tackling traditional themes of love along with less conventional ones such as sport, what most sets apart Duffy’s poetry from many of her contemporaries is its style, which, on the occasion of her appointment, Sarah Lyall in The New York Times described as ‘deceptively simple’ and which ‘produce[s] accessible, often mischievous poems dealing with the darkest turmoil and the lightest minutiae of everyday life’ (Lyall 2009).

Perhaps Duffy’s style is best exemplified by her 1999 volume, The World’s Wife, in which she presents short dramatic monologues from the women married to famous men throughout history, mythology, and literature. She presents the stories of ‘Mrs. Darwin’, ‘Mrs. Sisyphus’, and ‘Mrs. Quasimodo’, among others. Clever, humorous, and filled with poems that even rhyme, The World’s Wife sold tremendously well and began to be used regularly in classrooms. Yet critics felt that the collection was of substantially different quality when compared to her three previous, prize-winning collections. As Jeanette Winterson reported in a profile on Duffy, The World’s Wife prompted reactions that had critics ‘ask[ing] questions about whether Duffy had lost her balance. Had she stopped writing poetry and slipped into verse?’ (Winterson).

While Duffy did not comment publicly on such evaluations of her work, undergraduate students in my Spring 2009 poetry class discovered evidence that she was aware of a difference between The World’s Wife and those volumes that had preceded it. While exploring her recently acquired papers (http://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/duffy834/) in Emory University’s Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Book Library (MARBL), the students found an undated letter from Duffy to the publisher of her previous volumes. She writes that she will be publishing The World’s Wife with another press: ‘…this book is not a “normal” poetry collection by me – it’s closer to popular entertainment, if you like’ (Duffy). So while Duffy later told Winterson that the question of perceived differences in her volumes doesn’t concern her (Winterson), her letter makes it clear that she perceives real differences prior to the publication of The World’s Wife.

This discovery by my students in a 2009 became the seed for the capstone project in my current course, ‘Introduction to Digital Humanities’ (http://www.briancroxall.net/dh): we are testing Duffy’s own words to see whether The World’s Wife truly does differ from her ‘“normal” poetry collection[s].’ To this end, we are reading The World’s Wife alongside her previous volume, Mean Time (1993), which won both the prestigious Forward Poetry Prize and Whitbread Poetry Award. Initially, students wrote essays that employed close reading to make an argument about whether or not there are differences between the two volumes. The class then turned to less traditional modes of analysis. Each student was assigned a number of poems from each volume to transcribe, preparatory for analysis in the suite of Voyant (http://hermeneuti.ca/voyeur), formerly Voyeur (Rockwell 2011), designed by Stéfan Sinclair and Geoffrey Rockwell. Students used different facets of Voyant to explore possible shifts in Duffy’s language between the two texts: word frequency, the number of unique words, word collocation, and more. With other tools, we tested the relative line lengths between the volumes and the readability scores of Duffy’s language. Students worked in teams on the different modules to understand and interpret their results. The class also turned to the archives and Duffy’s notebooks to determine (anecdotally) the rate of changes and corrections between particular poems in the different volumes. Finally, inspired by Stephen Ramsay’s arguments that ‘Digital Humanities is about building things’ and Mark Sample’s suggestion that digital humanities is ‘about sharing’, the students built interpretive arguments about their findings and shared them via the course website.

As mentioned, this poster reports on the processes of designing a digital humanities research project, the process of making those findings public, and the exposure of undergraduates to some of the basic tools and methods of textual analysis. It incorporates not only the results of textual analysis, but also feedback from students about their experience learning new tools and approaches, including a strong emphasis on collaboration – a rarity in most humanities coursework. The presentation continues the trend to discuss the intersection of pedagogy and digital humanities; multiple panels on this subject are being convened at the 2012 Modern Language Convention, for example, and the 2011 Digital Humanities conference at Stanford featured posters by Katherine D. Harris and Beth Bonsignore et al. on the subject (Croxall & Berens 2011; Harris 2011a, 2011b; Bonsignore 2011). This presentation in particular builds on Harris’s work on the necessity of uncertainty when designing opportunities for ‘ play ’ by presenting students with a research assignment in which the outcomes are not yet predetermined by the instructor (Harris 2011b).

While reporting on original text analysis research, this presentation simultaneously examines how undergraduates and pedagogy are important facets of the increasingly diverse community of practice that is digital humanities.

The Great Recession beginning in 2008 has resulted in a series of budgetary cuts to many universities, education programs, and cultural institutions that reflect indifference about, and even hostility toward, the humanities and arts in favor of scientific, engineering, business, and other applied fields. Even scientists are now concerned about the perceived legitimacy of their ""basic research"" when it lacks evident short-term application. However, the sciences have an established tradition of public advocacy and media communication that is quite effective in putting their discoveries before the public. The humanities have no such consistent, planned tradition of advocacy, and in many ways are starting from scratch.

This paper argues for and demonstrates planned humanities advocacy using the special affordances of the digital humanities. In particular, it discusses how the 4Humanities initiative is leveraging DH for next-generation advocacy. In this paper, we will:

Show how 4Humanities uses DH to help analyze public discourse, both pro and con, about the humanities (including text analysis of such discourse as well as crowd-sourced generation of arguments for the humanities).
Show how statistics and other evidence about the contribution of the humanities to society can be analyzed and visualized in support of effective arguments.
Discuss the role of 4Humanities and, more generally, how DH can provide special tools for humanities advocacy, while humanities advocacy can in return incentivize the creation of next-generation DH research and teaching tools with a built-in public engagement dimension.
Analysis of Arguments Against the Humanities
One way to bolster advocacy for the humanities is first to look closely at the arguments made in public against them. We have compiled a small corpus of recent articles (especially from news sources accessed by a broad public) representative of criticisms of the humanities (Auslin, 2012; Bauerlein, 2011; Cohan, 2012a; Cohan, 2012b; Ellouk, 2011; Fendrich, 2009; Fish, 2007; Fish 2008; Fund, 2012; Knapp, 2011; Murdoch, 2011; Pidgeon, 2007; Riley, 2012; Sini, 2011; Stephens, 2012; Wente, 2012; Wood, 2012).


Fig 1:
Voyant Collocate Cluster Visualization (Sinclair and Rockwell)

We find that arguments critical of the humanities cluster around certain ideas. Principally, detractors accuse the humanities of lacking cultural and/or economic relevance. The most nuanced critiques mix or shade the charges of cultural and economic irrelevance. But other arguments refute the social usefulness of the humanities entirely, simply taking for granted their complete economic and social irrelevance. (Interestingly, however, some of these articles also defend irrelevance as a virtue, as in the case of arguments from friends of the humanities who feel that irrelevance is the basic nature of the humanities and is perfectly acceptable.)

A related critique of the professoriate in the humanities is that our work is no longer accessible to a larger educated public. The argument is that we are our own worst enemies because we have descended into theoretical turf battles that no one cares about. For these commentators such cultural irrelevance goes hand in hand with the supposed lack of respect that academics show for the public’s values, as epitomized in Marxism, feminism, post-colonialism, and other approaches that attack iconic ideas. The antidote sometimes proposed is a return to a nebulous concept of the traditional humanities — e.g., to the venerable search for the “beautiful.”

This paper will summarize our reading of the articles as well as present results from some text analysis of other rhetoric about the humanities.

Analysis of Arguments For the Humanities
As important as it is to know the arguments critical of the humanities, it is also important to gather good arguments for the humanities. 4Humanities has taken two approaches to this. The first is to blog good arguments as we come across them with summaries for those who are looking for essays to help them in their advocacy. We have also summarized these in a digestible form for people to review (Bielby, 2012). Finally we ran an All Our Ideas vote on the value of the humanities (http://allourideas.org/4humanities). At the time of writing this proposal there were over 1600 votes and 31 user submitted possible answers (as opposed to 12 seeds that we provided.) The top choices at the time of writing included:


There is obviously overlap in the top choices, but these indicate what the digital humanities community considers important. In the paper we will provide a fuller analysis of the data along with our list of the best arguments.

Looking Closely at the Statistics
“Liberal arts graduates frequently catch or surpass graduates with career-oriented majors in both job quality and compensation.” (Koc, 2011)

In addition to defining and communicating the cultural value of the humanities, the 4Humanities initiative is also committed to gathering data on the economic value of the humanities. One of the most pernicious arguments against the humanities has been the poor job prospects of graduating humanists. For this reason, we review the statistical arguments carefully, especially to highlight the fact that the data on compensation of humanists at mid-career paints a different story. A humanist may find it harder to get a first job with a degree, but she/he will probably rise faster than many with professional certification.

When making arguments for the humanities’ contribution to society, of course, it can be difficult to produce statistics, given that there has been no comprehensive study that gathers together available facts and figures in a usable manner. As part of the 4Humanities project we have been compiling and listing all statistics we can find in the published literature about the benefit of the humanities to society. This was done by collating the literature – including newspaper articles, reports, websites, and op-ed pieces (listed on the 4Humanities website) – and locating numeric references to the humanities. We have compiled such quantitative evidence, and at DH2013 we will present an infographic that sums up the statistical argument that the humanities are relevant to economic and intellectual development.

In addition, we have recently begun our “Infographics Friday” series (http://humanistica.ualberta.ca/category/for-the-public/humanities-infographics/), highlighting a particular statistic or graphical representation on the 4Humanities website once a week, to demonstrate the range of evidence. A core remit of 4Humanities is to gather, analyse, and disseminate this disparate information to provide a knowledge base upon which others can build their opinions and bolster their understanding of the humanities.

Conclusion: 4Humanities and a Digital Humanities response to the Cuts, Crisis, and Criticism
We argue that the mission of public engagement and advocacy in the humanities as embodied by the 4Humanities initiative provides a unique way to consolidate leading technological and methodological directions in DH with outreach to society. The humanities today have an advantage that was not available earlier: the analytical and communication methods of the digital humanities. Not only do the digital humanities provide a strong argument for the relevance of humanities learning in a digital age; they also provide unique, fresh ways of studying the contributions of the humanities to society and then getting the message out. DH research and humanities advocacy can be one, where DH helps advance advocacy, and, reciprocally, the advocacy mission helps drive research in DH. The hunt is now on to develop and extend new generations of digital humanities platforms and tools that can integrate the core research and teaching work of humanists with public visibility and engagement. Such platforms and tools (for publishing, editing, research, pedagogy, etc.) can be designed from the ground up, both to serve the needs of academics and to engage with today's networked public. This paper is a step in that direction.

One of the common skills covered in introductory digital humanities courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels is computer-assisted text analysis. This workshop will introduce participants to ways of teaching text analysis with the online text analysis environment, Voyant Tools (voyant-tools.org). Unlike previous workshops that have been focused on using Voyant Tools for research, this workshop is aimed at participants who want to introduce text analysis into their teaching. Participants are not expected to know much about text analysis or Voyant; this workshop will include a brief hands-on component to introduce text analysis with Voyant as an example of what can be done.
Outline of the workshop
The workshop will take the following form.
•        Introductions: where the instructors and participants introduce themselves and their teaching context.
•        Brief example of teaching text analysis with Voyant: where participants are led through a hands-on introduction to Voyant as if they were students.
•        Discussion of example: where we discuss how the hands-on example tutorial could work (or not) in an undergraduate class.
•        Models for text analysis: where we break into groups that develop models for how they might use text analysis in a course. Some might develop a model for introducing text analysis in a literature course, some in a digital humanities course.
•        Managing the module: where we discuss what can go wrong and what learning resources there are.
•        Why bother: where we conclude with a discussion of the place of text analysis in the digital humanities curriculum.
What is text analysis and why teach it?
Text analysis is about asking questions of a text with the help of a computer. As such it is a research method of interest to any who interpret texts. Computer-assisted text analysis tools evolved out of the concordance as a tool for studying a text by searching it for patterns and gathering passages that agree in some way. Early text analysis tools like COCOA and OCP were designed to produce print concordances from the early electronic texts being entered in the 1960s and 70s (Lancashire 1986). With interactive programs like TACT in the late 1980s we saw tools designed to support research on the computer screen (Lancashire 1996). Now text analysis tools like Voyant are available as online web services that you can upload a text to. The newer tools can handle large e-texts and they provide text mining and visualization features. Tools like HyperPo and Voyant can be thought of as reading tools designed to provide multiple interfaces for interpretation (Sinclair 2003). These online tools make it possible to teach text analysis without having students struggle with the complexities of pre-indexing tools, special markup, or installing software.
Teaching text analysis has been part of introductory digital humanities courses because of the important place of electronic texts in computing in the humanities. Humanities computing grew out of early concording efforts like the Index Thomisticus of Father Busa (Busa 1980). As we developed models for how to represent texts in electronic form we began to ask what might be learned from these electronic texts. What questions might be asked of etexts that we couldn’t ask in close reading of a text? Teaching text analysis is a way of letting students see the opportunities and limits to algorithmic criticism, as Stephen Ramsay calls it (Ramsay 2008). Teaching text analysis lets them engage with what the computer can really do in the way of analyzing (taking apart or tokenizing) information and synthesizing new views on information like visualizations. It is also a way of introducing students to research methods that they can use in their studies of texts.
Models for integrating text analysis into a course
Text analysis can be woven into a course in different ways. It can be integrated as a short module just to give students a taste or it can be taught in depth as a research method. In this workshop we will look at three models for integrating text analysis into a course:
•        Short module in an undergraduate class: First, we will look at how this can be taught as a one week module in an undergraduate class with a hands-on tutorial. This is the example that we will walk through with the participants as if they were students.
•        One day workshop: Second, we will look at how text analysis can be taught in a one day workshop for students and colleagues. We will discuss how instructors can set tasks for students to tackle on their own and how one can alternate hands-on instruction with discussion.
•        Research methods for graduate students: Lastly we will cover how one might teach text analysis to graduate students who are going to use it as a research method. In this context we will discuss readings that can be assigned and projects one can assign. We will talk about other tools and resources that graduate students may need for research projects. We will discuss how data can be prepared for Voyant and how data can be extracted from Voyant for other tools. Voyant can be part of a larger suite of tools graduate students use in real research.
In all of these cases there are some common types of materials we will have for participants:
•        Scripts: We will walk through online scripts that can be used for teaching Voyant. These scripts with links to all the resources needed are based on our working scripts that have been tested teaching Voyant around the world. (Seehttp://hermeneuti.ca/workshops for example scripts).
•        Readings: We will share an annotated bibliography of readings about text analysis that can be used with students.
•        Examples: One of the hardest things to teach is how text analysis might be reported in a real research paper. We will share examples of research reports, papers and blog essays that show how others have used text analysis and woven it into assignments.
•        Other Tools: Students who are pursuing original questions almost always run up against the limitations of any particular tool. We will share a list of other tools and discuss how Voyant can be used both to analyze hybrid texts from other tools or to export data for use with other tools.
What can go wrong?
An important part of the workshop will be a final discussion of what can go wrong with Voyant in a classroom and how to deal with it. Courses that introduce computing tools need to be carefully paced and tested so that the technology does not hold back the learning. When teaching with any online tool you need to have contingencies for when the server goes down or is busy with other queries. In the case of Voyant we now have backup servers and a resolver that was set up specifically for training situations. In the workshop we will go over how to prepare for teaching Voyant, how to set up multiple versions of the indexed texts that are being used for a class, and other tactics for dealing with delays with Voyant. For those that are interested we will also discuss how they can set up Voyant on their own servers so that they have control.

Knuth argued that more emphasis should be placed on explaining to humans what computers are meant to do, rather than simply instructing computers what to do. Knuth was especially interested in weaving together macrostyle code snippets with prose that provided a larger narrative context, not merely functional comments of specific lines of code that are the distilled remnants of an intellectual process.
Literate programming has been more influential in theory than in practice (Nørmark), despite several utilities and environments including Mathematica, Knuth's (C)WEB, Sweave for R, and Marginalia for Clojure. Perhaps the exigencies of programming in the real world correspond poorly with the vision of Knuth of the programmer as author: ""the practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of style"" (1992, 1). However, that balance of essayist and coder strikes us as perfectly appropriate for the digital humanities, a natural blend of the expression of intellectual process with the exposition of technical methodologies. The prose can gloss the code, or viceversa, in a symbiotic relationship that serves to strengthen an argument and demonstrate its own workings.
One of the most significant potential benefits of the literate programming paradigm is pedagogical: these works can both explain an interpretive insight and present the methodology for reproducing the data or results that were part of the process. Many widely-read digital humanities blogs already present these characteristics of exploration, explanation, interpretation and step-by-step instructions (see for example blogs by Ted Underwood, Benjamin Schmidt, Lisa Rhody and Scott Weingart). Literate programming can be more self-contained and more useful for those learning new methodologies and new programming techniques. This is about the principles of literate programming, but also about the potential for increasing programming literacy.
This poster will introduce Voyant Notebooks, a web-based literate programming environment designed for the digital humanities (see Appendix A). There is already a working prototype and we anticipate having a more feature-rich version available by July 2013. Voyant Notebooks inherits many of the characteristics of the Voyant Tools environment, including a concern for usability and flexibility (researchers and students should be able to use it with minimal or no training and with their own texts of interest). Voyant Notebooks also addresses one of the main weaknesses of Voyant Tools: the fact that most tools are constrained by assumptions about how they would be most commonly used. For instance, the Wordle-like (word cloud) Cirrus tool is designed to show the top frequency terms from a corpus or document; but what if the user instead wants to visualize the top frequency nouns, or people, or repeating phrases? All of that functionality could be built into the tool, but possibly at the cost of usability (endless menus and options), and it could still never address all of the possible use cases. Voyant Notebooks, by contrast, empowers the user to customize some of the functionality by leveraging the analytic capabilities of the Voyant back-end and the visualization interfaces in the front-end (like Cirrus). Our poster will have two parts, a) a usable demonstration on one or more laptops and b) a poster that illustrates how Voyant Notebooks implements Knuth’s concept of literate programming. In addition to these conceptual aspects, the poster will outline technical details about the Voyant Notebooks prototype for those interested, including the technologies used for both client-side (browser) and server-side components. Some of the technical challenges that will be described include:
•        managing the flow of code execution in an asynchronous architecture,
•        using web workers to avoid browser freezes during longer executions,
•        mitigating the security risks of user-defined and persistent Javascript code,
•        code variable scoping across editor instances and window components,
•        embedding of Voyant tool panels (visualizations) and other services,
•        developing a flexible API for different programming levels and styles,
•        developing an API that includes both client-side and server-side operations, and

This poster will present findings evaluating the development, launch, and reception of the app, indicating how smartphone technology can increase the potential for public engagement within the Digital Humanities.
Textal (soon to be launched at www.textal.org, currently on twitter at @textal) will be a freely available smartphone application which allows users to create, share, and explore word clouds of a document, website, or tweet stream. Those in visualization and Digital Humanities have tended to sneer at the popular use of word clouds (Harris 2011, Meeks 2012), given we are used to applying robust text analysis tools (such as http://voyant-tools.org/). However, Textal turns word clouds into an intuitive, visually-oriented interface: once a Textal of a chosen text is generated, users can click on words to access underlying statistics, such as frequency and collocates, and so we believe that the pinch, stretch, and click potential in smartphones, along with our judicious design, can fix the elements of word cloud visualization which are currently held to be problematic and act as a bridge between those who have never encountered text analysis techniques, and the more detailed approaches undertaken by researchers in Digital Humanities. All Textal visualizations, including word-clouds, graphs, charts, and word lists, can be shared via social media such as Twitter and Facebook, and the resulting interface word clouds will also be available online. Textal is powered by server-side processing of linguistic data (users can submit any text material they want, by URL, or copy or paste). The resulting sever architecture will also serve as an API for those wishing to carry out on-the-fly generation of text analysis statistics, which can be used in conjunction with other web services.
We envision the Textal iPhone, and iPad, app as a fun text-analysis-in-your-pocket product, which can raise the profile of this technique. We have built Textal with the general audience in mind, to bring Digital Humanities approaches to as wide an international audience as possible (we will be translating the interface into many languages). With an increasing move towards smartphone rather than desktop technologies (Tofel 2012) there is a need to understand how mobile technologies fit within the Digital Humanities remit. We believe we are one of the first teams to build, from scratch, a stand-alone app that brings Digital Humanities techniques to a wider, mobile based, audience. (Previous apps, do exist, such as the DH2012 conference app (https://itunes.apple.com/app/dh2012/id536290090?mt=8), which is an app based version of the conference programme. Geostoryteller is a platform for history walking tours that allow smartphone users to interact with multimedia historical information as they move around a neighbourhood (http://www.geostoryteller.org/index.php, see Rabina and Cocciolo 2012.). Others have used augmented reality viewers for historical and archaeological sites (see http://www.dead-mens-eyes.org/), often built on existing commercial platforms. We don’t believe, however, that others have built smartphone apps that allow the user to do much data analysis or processing in the way we describe).
We are building Textal from the ground up using our own server infrastructure, with the app programmed in house in Objective-C. Textal will be available for iOS only, with a plan to build a stand-alone application for use with Apple laptop and desktops. Depending on reception, we may then build an app for other operating systems. Given that we own the infrastructure, we will be able to view and analyse how, why and when people are using text analysis: we will be tracking use and users, including geo-locating text analysis, to ascertain the potential audience for this type of service and to understand more about the kind of texts people want to analyse, allowing us to undertake a reception study into Textal’s uptake, which will be of great interest to the wider Digital Humanities audience.
Although the app will not be launched until Summer 2013 this is not a promissory abstract: most of the development, including both technical infrastructure, server architecture, and design-work on the app, is now complete and at time of submission we are moving into alpha-testing with a core group of users interested in text analysis. This poster will be an up-to-the-minute account of a very recent development in Digital Humanities: what ramifications do apps hold for Digital Humanities as a discipline or a field of practice? We will report using up-to-date statistics generated from Textal as a case study, and demonstrate Textal at the poster session.

An Introduction to the Design of New Knowledge Environments

INKE Research Group||
In this panel, we report on our year 4 work in the Interface Design (ID) research team of the Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE) project. INKE is a 7-year major collaborative research initiative (MCRI) project funded in Canada by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). INKE is led by Ray Siemens at the University of Victoria, and includes dozens of researchers worldwide. Each year, we have had a different focus for our work. The schedule is as follows:

Year 1: interdisciplinary citations
Year 2: corpora
Years 3 and 4: the scholarly edition
Year 5: the monograph and journal
Year 6: born-digital literature
Year 7: wrap-up and dissemination
For the first three years of the project, our focus has been on a wide range of experimental prototypes. Beginning in year 4, we attempted to aggregate these prototypes into a smaller set of “new knowledge environments”, where the goal is no longer to have a single piece of functionality that we can experiment with, but instead to begin imagining how the various pieces of functionality, as represented by our prototypes, can work in concert to produce an environment for people working with electronic books.

What makes these environments “new” is that they are comprised of a set of experiments into working with digital text. More often than not, these experiments involve the design and programming of a prototype, which may exist at any one of a range of levels of fidelity. Ideally, the lowest level of fidelity is developed that is necessary in order to come to grips with the central idea. To develop further is sometimes required in order to achieve an adequate user experience study, but in any case it is important to keep in mind that the end goal is the extension of our understanding rather than the production of a piece of stable software.

So the process is to conceive of a concept and produce a prototype to help us better understand the concept. Typically a prototype will generate some new knowledge itself, and that knowledge can contribute to the next iteration of the idea. In some cases, the prototype teaches us enough that there is no need for a further prototype. If what we’ve learned is of potential use, then we can consider a more robust implementation of the idea. If what we’ve learned is that the line of thought we’ve been pursuing may not be fruitful after all, then we can at that point abandon the trajectory and move to another idea.

In the case of the year 4 projects in INKE, we have selected some prototypes that we think deserve to be aggregated into an environment. We are at the same time trying to learn what we can about the theoretical and technical issues involved in this kind of redesign and reprogramming for the purposes of aggregation. These are environments rather than simpler tools in the sense that they afford more than a single task or set of tasks.

In the papers that follow, we describe each of the environments, examine the state of the art in scholarly editions for tablets, and discuss the user experience study of two of the prototypes that have gone on to inform one of our new knowledge environments.

2. Reading Skins: Voyant and Tool Aggregation
Rockwell, Geoffrey|grockwel@ualberta.ca|University of Alberta
Sinclair, Stéfan|stefan.sinclair@mcgill.ca|McMaster University
INKE Research Group||
Tools are not just ways to ask questions - they are also reading skins. Interface designers have known this for some time. They design interfaces to present affordances and views that facilitate different types of reading. A dictionary is designed for consultation reading (Blair 2010), a manual for training. Likewise an e-book minimizes distractions, presenting “just the text”, while text analysis environments embed the texts in alternative ways of reading, from visualizations to interactive controls. These design choices are based on a model of the reader and the tasks they are engaged in. In this paper we will look at the types of interfaces or “skins” presented by text analysis environments and end by discussing the decisions taken in the design of Voyant. We will do that in the following ways:

1 First, we will look back at one of the first computing humanists to consider visualization and the interface to text analysis tools, John Smith.
2 Second, we will survey different types of text analysis interfaces.
3 Third, we will close by discussing how the architecture of Voyant is designed to allow for different reading skins that aggregate different tools to suit different uses.
1. First Thoughts on the Interface
One of the first computing humanists to think about the interface to text analysis tools was John Smith. John Smith in “Computer Criticism” and other articles proposed a way that analytical tools like his ARRAS could fit into interpretative research practices. He saw the computer as a tool to help identify and then trace structures through a text and gave an example of how this can help rereading a text in his article “Image and Imagery in Joyce's Portrait.” In “A New Environment For Literary Analysis” he explicitly discussed how the analytical tool ARRAS was not meant to replace the inquirer but to amplify them, how it could provide what we today call visualizations, and how it should be thought of not as a program, but as an environment for work where one could switch from text analysis to editing the text or sending a message. In the presentation we will go into more detail about how Smith articulated the relationship between tool design and interpretative practices.

2. Survey of Type of Interface
In the second part of the paper we will survey various interface paradigms for text analysis tools including:

ARRAS: We will start with the interface John Smith developed for ARRAS, and discuss his ideas for a humanities accessible command line language.
TACT and TACTweb: We will then discuss TACT, which was released in 1989 and designed by John Bradley and others (Lancashire 1996). TACT, while running in MS DOS, was influenced by the then new idea of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It had a primitive windowing model that let you split the screen to see multiple displays and use one to drive the other(s). TACTweb, which came later, brought TACT functionality to the web, and illustrated for the first time how the web separated interface from text database so that multiple interfaces could be built.
HyperPo: While HyperPo (hyperpo.org) wasn’t the first text analysis environment on the web, it was one of the first to fully exploit the web. It let you upload a text and it provided a number of innovative features including making displays themselves affordances for further interaction. It was also explicitly designed as a reading environment.
TextArc: One of the most beautiful interfaces to text analysis is the TextArc (textarc.org) visual concordance designed by W. Bradford Paley. This work pushes the idea of interface in interesting directions as it can be considered a work of art or design meant to be appreciated in and of itself rather than as a window onto something else.
Other interfaces could be mentioned like the visual programming interface idea of Eye-ConTACT that is also available in SEASR or the library interface of the MONK project, but these are more management interfaces than reading ones.

3. Voyant and Skins
In the last part of the presentation we will discuss the layered architecture of Voyant that allows one to create different combinations of tools into “skins” that aggregate different tools. A Skin Builder tool for creating your own skins will be demonstrated and different examples of skins for different reading purposes will be shown. Different uses call for different combinations of tools.

All of these text analysis interfaces are presented from the perspective that they are views on a static object that is studied, but what if the object of study is changing? What if we think of text analysis tools performing the text rather than skin it? The presentation will end with an alternative prototype interface designed not for reading, but for animating the text as if it were a performance.

“Typography is to literature as musical performance is to composition: an essential act of interpretation, full of endless opportunities for insight or obtuseness.”

— Robert Bringhurst, The Elements of Typographic Style
As humanities scholars transition from reading traditional print texts to reading on computer screens, ebooks and tablets, we are discovering that the visible word has taken a step backwards in quality. Typographic considerations are often the most challenging aspects of user experience development of digital reading environments. Ereaders are still in their infancy, and thus far little attention has been paid to textual design beyond very basic choices of typeface and font size.

We have developed the Dynamic Table of Contexts, a text analysis environment that combines the traditional concepts of the table of contents and index to create new methods for Humanities scholars to read and interact with digital text. The main interface consists of four interactive panes that perform dynamically with each other: the table of contents, the index, the xml tag list and a large pane to read the text itself (see Figure 1). In addition, there is a pane for reader notes. The Dynamic Table of Contexts interface is predominantly textual in nature, but the text at the centre of it is itself an interface – the point of interaction between the reader and that which is read. This study examines the appearance and arrangement of the textual interface within the larger interface. We asked: how can we typographically optimize the ereading experience?

The guiding fundamentals of typography are legibility and readability. Legibility concerns the ease with which a letterform can be recognized and readability refers to the ease with which text can be understood (Lupton 2004). Many problems with legibility have arisen in the transition from print to screen. For example, rather than black ink on a paper page, black text on a screen is an absence in the glowing pixels that surround it, and the result is perceived as blurry regardless of screen resolution. Anti-aliasing is used to compensate for low resolution on most computer monitors but can't be applied consistently from character to character because of where the letter may land on the physical pixel grid. In an effort to offset this problem font size is often increased, which in itself can become a reading irritant and navigationally awkward as larger type creates shorter lines of text which in turn requires more left-right eye movements from the end of one line to the beginning of the next. Fewer lines of text also necessitate more scrolling which is visually uncomfortable and requires additional time and visual energy for the reader to relocate himself in the text after each movement. While we wait for technology to catch up in these areas, this study outlines the methods we used to minimize legibility issues and discusses which existing typefaces (most of which, it must be remembered, were never intended for the screen) best counteract blurring and movement. We identify optimal type size and line length combinations for comfortable extended on-screen reading in the Dynamic Table of Contexts.

Compared to legibility, issues of readability are less often addressed in discussions of digital reading environments. Readability is comprised not only of the arrangement of type on a page or screen, but also of attention to the entire visual entity and all the complex relationships between levels of type, symbols and images (Berryman 1984). Typography imparts semantic meaning as it interprets content and influences meaning by creating hierarchies, assigning values, and manipulating emphasis (Bachfischer, Robertson and Zmijewska 2007). Our investigations into optimal readability design for the Dynamic Table of Contexts raised interesting questions about the representation of text and the process of reading on-screen. In the remediation from print to screen, do we still read the same way? Do the rules that apply to the readability of print typography apply to on-screen typography? Do conventions that govern readability of websites also apply to extended reading of scholarly materials?

In this study we have also examined other components of the textual interface that affect readability but that are not necessarily typographic in nature. Often on-screen paging representations (such as a simulated left and right sides of a double page spread or an animated page turning) give the illusion of a traditional print book. We examine theories of whether these provide valuable perceptual cues to the reader or are simply a vestigial device that has lost its significance in a changing environment.

This research represents a move from an adequate to an optimized reading environment.

How have scholarly editions been implemented on tablets? In the past few years, a significant number of scholarly editions have seen deployment on the Web, and the differences between printed editions and Web-based ones has become a matter of attention for many scholars. In this paper, we will investigate scholarly editions as they appear in tablets and other mobile devices.

Web-based scholarly editions offer many new features that do not and cannot exist in printed ones. Such features include opportunities for collaboration with other users or with the editors of the work, innovative methods to search and browse, specialized tools and visualizations for text analysis, means to customize the layout of the interface and the content, options to change the language of the interface or to see translations of the text, high resolution zoomable images, multimedia elements such as video and audio, and a wealth of material that would be too costly or cumbersome to include in a printed edition.

Despite these advantages, some users still prefer their scholarly editions to be in paper form. Reasons may include a lack of physical distance between reader and book, and the ability to interact directly with the material. Tablets have solved these problems to some extent, emulating the physicality of paper books, and allowing users an opportunity to touch and feel them. As Elena Pierazzo notes, “Usability studies have demonstrated that reading on tablets is more enjoyable than reading on the screen of computers and, in some cases, more than reading print” (Pierazzo 2011). Additionally, the fact that an app is an independent program housed on a particular machine results in increased speed and stability over Web-based editions, which also serves to reproduce some of the positive features of paper-based editions (McDayter 2012).

Tablets represent a return to printed editions in some more negative respects as well. For instance, users cannot create shared annotations or collaborate with each other in other ways; the app on the tablet is isolated from references and related material available on the Web; tools for text analysis are absent; and no options are provided to show the interface in different languages. Part of the reason for these omissions in tablets may be due to the fact that editions that are currently available on tablets have generally been produced more for a popular audience than a scholarly one. This is reflected not only in terms of functionalities of the interface, but with respect to the content as well. Bibliographies, glossaries, and textual apparatuses are typically missing, variants tend not to be included, and notes and annotations have been recycled from older print-based editions, rather than being the result of new scholarship. Tablet-based editions are often more focused on making an edition attractive and amusing than on making it scholarly, and may include games or quizzes, methods of sharing passages or images via social media sites, and other innovative but potentially distracting features likely to be of interest to keen fans of the material rather than to scholars.

So, tablets are in a way mediating between print and the Web, sharing some of the advantages and disadvantages of both. But what effects will these advantages and disadvantages have on scholarly editions? Do scholarly editions have a future in tablets? These are questions that we will discuss in this paper.

At this point, very few tablet-based scholarly editions have been released, and as discussed above, those that have are decidedly unscholarly in some respects. Touch Press has produced some notable examples, including editions of T.S Eliot’s The Waste Land, Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks, and Shakespeare’s sonnets. The Waste Land is the first edition produced by Touch Press, and continues to stand up as a nice example of the genre. This edition allows the poem to be viewed as plain text, and includes annotations, audio recordings, facsimile images of the original typescript, filmed performance of the poem, interviews about the poem and some image galleries.

Many of the features provided in The Waste Land would make using scholarly editions easier and more pleasurable. As is the case with most works of philosophy, art, and literature, The Waste Land is multi-layered, and multimedia is of great help in exploring, finding and analyzing the different existing layers. Study is also eased and enhanced by being able to quickly and easily reveal or hide information, switch between viewing multiple encodings of the text, and simply by having the ability to manually scroll through the text, rather than having to use a device.

With what has been discussed, some questions require further exploration. Will the advantages of tablet-based editions win out over their disadvantages? Will the tablet become accepted as an appropriate medium in which to produce and study scholarly editions? In this paper, we will consider whether scholarly editions have a future on tablets and how such a future might look.

The INKE Interface Design group has been exploring the application of multi-touch table technology for improving the comprehension, manipulation, and analysis of variorum editions beyond what has been accomplished in previous digital variorums. These volumes consist of three general components: the text of the work itself as selected by an editor; a list of variations between this ‘base-text’ and other manuscript or printed versions; and a comprehensive anthology of previous scholarly annotations on a particular line, passage, or the entire work. For many texts the existing notes are so extensive that it is difficult in a print medium to present “…simultaneous access to text and relevant commentary”, leading to an effort since the mid-nineteen-nineties to produce digital variorum editions (Werstine 2011).

Scholarly editions, especially variorums, raise interesting questions about the representation of elements and the act of reading. The richness of this type of edition creates dilemmas related to the organization of different pieces of information, as well as interacting with the text. A print version presents physical space constraints, such as the two-page spread and the necessity of linear presentation. This constraint become less of an issue in a digital environment, where space, time, and dimensionality in general are more fluid.

Although current iterations of digital variora (for example, the Online Chopin Variorum Edition, and the Electronic Variorum Edition of Don Quixote) attempt to take advantage of this flexibility of the medium, they present themselves as flat webpages, losing physical engagement with the materiality of the book. In order to bring back fuller physicality, we have used multi-touch surface technologies to simulate the “real space”, and to return to full gestures as opposed to clicks. A few projects focusing on eBooks and tablets have begun to emerge with the same idea (for example, The Wasteland, Shakespeare's Sonnets and Kerouac's On the Road), but this technology has not yet been applied to variorum editions.

Our project, The Comedy of Errors Tangible Variorum, involves creating a tangible user interface representing the Modern Language Association’s variorum edition of Shakespeare’s Comedy of Errors in order to explore the affordances of this technology to increase collaborative scholarly research and interpretation of the material.

Existing digital variorums have attempted to encourage collaboration and interaction by incorporating features into their web page interfaces. In the Electronic Variorum Edition of Don Quixote (EVE-DQ) from Texas A&M’s Cervantes project, for example, users can add their own commentary and annotations which can then be accessed by future users. Similarly the Online Chopin Variorum Edition (OCVE) in progress at King’s College London allows the attachment of notes to the base text with an option to share them publicly. For both projects, however, adding comments is an individual activity, with a single user at a workstation inputting notes with a mouse and keyboard. There is little room for group interaction, and any that exists must be sequential rather than communal. Most previous electronic New Variorum Shakespeare (eNVS) projects, particularly the recent Winter’s Tale version, have no digital annotation function at all, limiting them to use as a reference tool, rather than an interactive platform.

Furthermore, it can be exceptionally difficult to allow simultaneous visual comparison of the numerous features of a variorum on these web page formats given the small size of most screens. A study by Wästlund, Norlander, and Archer on the effect of page layout on mental workload shows that “manipulating an onscreen text document via scrolling necessitates a shift of focus from the text to the action of controlling the page movement,” (Wästlund, Norlander, and Archer, 1243) leading to decreased performance on reading comprehension tasks. Vandendorpe (2009) writes that “navigation by means of a mouse tends to give rise to chaotic, extremely rapid movement that is not very favorable to reading” (133).

By using a multi-touch table as a display device this project attempts to solve the problems of poor collaboration and broken comprehension. There has been significant research supporting the use of touch screens in improving reader focus, for example a study by Eva Siegenthaler et al. (2012) found that subjects performed better at various tasks involved in reading when using devices with tangible inputs, concluding that “a touch screen allows for an easier and more intuitive interaction” than a non-touch screen (Eva Siegenthaler et al. 2012, 94). The sizes of both the screen and the table perimeter of a multi-touch device, meanwhile, are conducive to multiple users working together. We thus believe that the application of multi-touch technology will have two effects. First, it represents another stage in the remediation of variorums, one that will better allow us to implement Unsworth’s (2000) scholarly primitives: to sample, compare, discover, represent, annotate and reference different versions of the base text. Simultaneously, it encourages these tasks to be performed socially, deepening understanding by incorporating multiple viewpoints.

The collaborative uses of tangible devices in research situations is one of the main goals of this research. In driving towards this end, however, our group has faced issues in two camps: the ability of users to adapt to multiple people concurrently using touch controls; and, less expectedly, the ability of a designer to structure elements on an unconventional screen.

From the perspective of users, much of the challenge is about breaking habits. Since the introduction of personal computers, users have learned how to interact with the machine in individual work spaces. The adoption of this concept is so intense that one is liable to think that group work is less effective than work alone with the computer. However, it is noticeable that the technology has determined this situation: people cannot work together because the machine allows just one input at a time. The questions that we raise are: what happens when more than one person can interact with the machine? What kind of operations and collaborations can a group perform when all of them are engaged with the same machine in the same environment?

For designers, learning to think beyond the confines of a screen and mouse proved to be a major obstacle. The original design conceived of the mutli-touch screen as being suspended on the wall, and the elements were placed accordingly (Figure 1). As we built and tested the interface it became clear that the layout would be effective for a single user, but was not ideal for the collaboration we were trying to achieve. While flipping the screen to a table was a logical choice to allow more users to work simultaneously, reassessing the design from that perspective resulted in a number of questions: where do you place touchstone elements when there is no clear top or bottom? How can items being used by different people overlap without disrupting anyone’s work?

This paper explores the problems faced when building a social reading environment, both for users and for designers. The technology to allow such interaction exists: a multi-touch table has a size that allows for the display of multiple documents side-by-side, and its status as a touch screen enables easy and intuitive operation, lessening the mental workload required to operate it and permitting users to focus on the content rather than the interface. The system accommodates familiar gestures such as touch, pinch and flick to let the user move, select, grab and scroll through information on the screen, and since more than one point of interaction is possible, multiple people are able to work at the same time in the examination of the material, improving collaborative work. Designing for these features, however, is a mental challenge that requires an upset of standards in the minds of all those involved, users and builders, and facing these problems is a necessary step in moving towards the future of collaboration.

In 2011 Kevin Kee was asked to create and teach a class as part of a new interdisciplinary Humanities Ph.D. program. The graduate students taking the course would be largely unfamiliar with the digital humanities.

Kee began his preparation for the course by asking several questions. The first was ""what should an introductory digital humanities course attempt to accomplish""? As he searched for answers, another important question emerged: ""How could digital methods be used to design and deliver the course?"" In this paper, Kee and Spencer Roberts, a Research Assistant who worked with Kee, describe first their method for researching and designing the course. They then sketch the structure and content of the course that resulted from their research. Finally, they provide examples of student responses to the material and methods covered in the course (including Roberts's perspective as a graduate student). The collected responses and their reflections on the process suggest particular ways in which future courses of this kind might be designed, implemented, and improved. Most importantly, they found that an effective way to design and teach an introductory digital humanities course is to think about the discipline through discussions about its topics and to think with the discipline by using digital tools and methods in the classroom.

Overviews of digital humanities course offerings have been conducted throughout the past fifteen years. In 1999, Willard McCarty and Matthew Kirschenbaum identified only fourteen institutions that offered courses in humanities computing. In 2006, Melissa Terras conducted another survey of digital humanities curriculum, and in 2011, Lisa Spiro undertook to collect and analyze syllabi from digital humanities courses. Of these previous surveys, Spiro’s was the most comprehensive; she collected over 134 syllabi from various levels of study in the digital humanities. Although Spiro’s work parallels and was helpful to that of Kee and Roberts, the latter were unaware of her project when they began, and had no way to replicate her research method. As a result, Kee and Roberts drew on the results of their own analyses while designing the course.

For Kee and Roberts' research, Roberts designed a method by which syllabi were converted into sets of data representing reading lists, assignments, assessment methods, and digital tools used. Commonly occurring items from within those sets were highlighted and identified as items deemed important by the statistical consensus of instructors represented in their sample. For example, their results showed that seven authors of digital humanities-related articles and books appeared on reading lists at a significantly higher frequency than others; the data also showed that other instructors found these authors most useful. Kee drew on these results when deciding on readings for his course list.

Topics covered in the course included text encoding and markup, distant reading, building, mapping, modelling and simulating, playing and gaming, teaching, and collaborating. Each of these was paired with a practical application, usually drawn from a modified version of William Turkel’s ""Method"". For example, students learned the theory of text markup and were asked to create pages on the course wiki using the basic wiki standard markup. Franco Moretti’s theory of distant reading made more sense for students once they experimented with text mining and analysis tools such as Voyant. Kee’s assessment strategy required students to use blogs and Twitter to comment on the theories and tools they encountered; Kee also encouraged them to participate in scholarly discourse that occurs on the Web. Although most of the students studied history, Kee aimed to create an environment in which the digital humanities were understood as both theory and practice that could be incorporated into any humanities discipline.

Because Kee and Roberts hoped to learn from the experiences of graduate students new to the digital humanities, Kee built feedback mechanisms into the course assignments, and asked students to reflect on the course before and after completion. Nearly all of the students were challenged by the dual responsibility of learning theory and skills simultaneously. Although some students were relieved to finish experimenting, others were pleased with their progress and the opportunities for future research. One student commented, “Not only do I now have some new tools to use while I’m doing research… I’m also more open-minded towards using them in the first place and really trying to engage with them, rather than brushing them off.” While students readily adopted some of the tools, such as Zotero and Evernote, they found more complex tools such as DevonThink or Voyant required a level of commitment and time they did not want to make. In short, these students were not willing to commit to a new, digital research method at a time when they were simultaneously taking graduate courses rooted in conventional research methods. For some students, however, patience led to late or accidental discoveries that improved their methods; in at least one case, a student who was skeptical throughout the course became an enthusiastic supporter of digital methods and now avidly attends DH conferences and events. At the conclusion of the course, most students were open to the various theories and approaches used in the digital humanities, and were enthusiastic about trying new tools and experimenting with new methods that might improve their research and scholarship.

From the outset of the project, Kee and Roberts understood that they were asking questions for which there were several feasible answers. Some graduate level digital humanities courses focus on topics within the digital humanities; others primarily train students to develop digital skills using computational tools. Kee's approach was to combine these two approaches into one course that provided opportunity for theoretical discussion while also showcasing practical applications, so that students could see the potential beneDits of digital humanities methods without having to master sophisticated tools. The research method used to build the course syllabus employed the same theories and tools that were later discussed in the course, creating an iterative loop through which student feedback and developments in the discipline can be incorporated into future versions. Already there are new tools to improve the collection and analysis of digital humanities syllabi, and new methods being explored by instructors. Through the experimental approach described in this paper, Kee and Roberts have found that thinking about and thinking with the discipline, a method that many digital scholars employ in their research, is also an effective way to design a course, and appeals to students who are new to the discipline, fostering enthusiasm for its use in their own often conventional humanities scholarship. The authors hope that this approach contributes to the growing conversation about teaching digital humanities, while also reflecting and adapting to the dynamic topics within the field.",txt,This text is republished here with permission from the original rights holder.,,graduate course;method;pedagogy,English,"audio, video, multimedia;content analysis;digital humanities - pedagogy and curriculum;teaching and pedagogy"

LeBlanc;Michael Drout;Michael Kahn;Alicia Herbert;Richard Neal,"paper, specified ""short paper""","Integrating research and teaching is exciting, time intensive, and a prescription for energizing faculty and students. We present outcomes of a six-year effort in multidisciplinary collaboration centered on the digital humanities as experienced in our teaching and research. Rooted in a set of “connected” courses between English and Computer Science (LeBlanc, et al. 2010) and three summers of NEH-funded research, our Lexomics Research Group has developed a modest set of web-based applications for scholars of digitized texts. We report here on the iterative development of the open-source toolset, how scholars both in and outside our group have used these tools to make significant discoveries, and perhaps most important how our research and teaching collaborations introduce a spirit of experimentation to the digital humanities.

Our current website is both a repository for our tool set as well as an evangelistic platform and teaching resource: http://lexomics.wheatoncollege.edu. We continue to develop online tools for three independent, but logically connected functions that lead scholars through the steps needed for performing hierarchical cluster analyses of texts and/or sections of texts. At this point, our cluster analysis tools are more narrowly focused than other toolsets, c.f. Voyant Tools and the data-intensive flow execution environment of Meandre. Our scrubber tool (PHP, CSS) accepts texts in multiple formats (.txt, .html, .docx) and handles preprocessing steps including stripping tags, removing stop words, and applying lemma lists. A second tool, diviText (ExtJS, PHP), accepts the output from scrubber, cuts texts into “chunks” in one of three ways (fixed size chunks, a specific number of chunks, and/or by manually selecting locations between words for chunk breaks), computes word counts within each chunk, and allows users to merge chunks. The latter functionality has proved valuable for generating “virtual manuscripts”, that is, joining sections from different manuscripts. A third tool, treeView (PHP, R) accepts output from diviText, performs a number of variants of hierarchical cluster analysis, and returns a dendrogram plot in .pdf or phyloXML format.

Based on feedback from scholars who are using our tools, the website now provides video and written tutorials to help new users get started. These tutorials have been especially valuable for introducing these tools to our undergraduates. In the spirit of evangelizing, our website offers a series of “best practices” videos, discussions and step-by-step diagrams that shred insight to the process of how textual analysis at this level of detail can lead to rich new questions. The instructional videos include “The Story of Daniel”, a discussion of one of our initial successes when using the tools where we showed that lexomic methods can accurately characterize the structure and relationships of texts that are already known, for example, identifying Genesis B within the Old English Genesis and the section of Daniel that is paralleled in Azarias (Drout, et al. 2011). Other videos include: “How to Read a Dendrogram”, “How to Create a Dendrogram”, “How to Read a Ribbon Diagram”, “Lexomics for Comparison”, and “Lexomics for Source Detection”. A much longer video, “Editions and Manuscripts,” addresses the challenges of choosing between different kinds of editions that may exist for a text that is found in multiple forms.

We have made what we think are significant discoveries in a number of spaces, including Beowulf, the poems of Cynewulf, Anglo-Saxon prose, a few Old Norse sagas, and Modern English texts including the Harlem Renaissance play Mule Bone (by Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes). Lexomics is both an excellent first step to augment traditional scholarship as well as a rich source of deep analysis.

For example, previous lexomic analysis of several Old English poems suggests that there is a connection between dendrograms with an isolated, single leaf and poems that have an external source for one subsection of the poem different from the source or sources of the main body of the poem. We ﬁnd in the dendrogram of Daniel a single-leaf clade corresponding to lines 299–455 of the poem. This section includes parts of Daniel that have external Latin sources that are different from the source of the rest of the poem (the Latin Bible). Similarly, in the Anglo-Saxon poem Christ III, a single-leaf clade that represents lines 1350–1510 has its source in Sermon 57 of Cæsarius of Arles (lines 1379–1498), and a single-leaf clade in Genesis A (lines 1079–1256) is associated with the genealogical lists from Adam to Noah that give the lineages of both Cain and Seth (lines 1055–1252), material that, for at least some of its content, must have a source different from the biblical text. These relationships were already known to scholars, but our investigation of the Old English poem Guthlac A resolved a century-long critical controversy by demonstrating that a key section of this poem (when demons drag Guthlac to the mouth of hell) has a different proximate source than the rest of the poem and that Guthlac A therefore must have been composed after a separately circulating text similar in content to Vercelli Homily 23 (Downey et al., 2012).

The toolset, instructional materials, and publications are obvious deliverables from our efforts. Yet, we submit that our collaborative experiences with faculty and undergraduate students are even more exciting and provide a significant use-case of how scholarship in the humanities is evolving from the stereotypical solitary scholar to a paradigm of community, collaboration, and experimentation (cf. Unsworth, 1997). In our recent NEH- and locally-funded summer experience, humanities faculty in particular were pleasantly surprised with the intellectual environment that emerged. We got a glimpse of what it must have been like to work at a place like Bell Labs when they were making daily discoveries. This kind of collaborative, fast-moving research is unfortunately largely unknown in the humanities.

So how to continue our own momentum as well as replicate a spirit of experimentation for others? Earhart (2010) rightly notes that “digital projects remain rare, often the product of tenacious participants rather than a supportive academic environment”(emphasis added). We submit that faculty (not administrators nor technologists in the library) are the prime drivers and change must begin with our syllabi. Robust working relationships in the lab are strongest after students have already applied new modes of thinking in the classroom; for example, the importance of exposing undergraduate humanities students to computational thinking: problem decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and the success and failures of experimentation. And we need not overplay the lab metaphor. Our image of the digital humanities lab need not include beakers and soapstone benches, rather, the “new lab” is a room filled with scholars from multiple disciplines and a whiteboard.

Even if we had discovered nothing during our past summers in the lab, the intellectual thrill of the research group would have been a major accomplishment that these students (and we faculty) will never forget. But in fact we made discoveries, so many that there were days when participating faculty got none of their own work done because we were so busy bouncing from student to student seeing what they had found. Most critically, the experience continues to shape the way we share our disciplines with new cohorts of students. The solitary scholar still has a role to be sure, but that is no longer sufficient for the multidisciplinary demands and rewards to be gained from collaborations in the digital humanities: in our teaching, to our research, and back again.

Since 2003 the Centre for Information Modeling - Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities at the University of Graz (Austria) provides an infrastructure for a variety of DH projects. After years of building insular solutions, the Centre introduced a powerful yet flexible new infrastructure, called GAMS (Geisteswissenschaftliches Asset Management System, AMS for the Humanities). It is based on the Fedora Commons architecture. Thus, the infrastructure inherits all features already provided by Fedora: full OAIS-compliance, strict separation of data and metadata, and predefined interfaces like OAI-PMH. A central advantage of the Fedora architecture is its object model: An asset consists of a primary source, some metadata and virtual representations derived from the primary source. The object is completely self-descriptive: It knows about all changes that have been made to it, its version history, datastreams and assigned context objects. Finally, it also knows about all possible representation forms. Each object contains all the necessary information to store, preserve, retrieve and view it.
Cirilo Client: Mass operations in Fedora made easy

Although Fedora is a powerful tool, front-end object management is not always easy, especially with regard to mass operations. The Centre has developed a tool for this use case, complementing Fedora’s built-in Admin Client. Cirilo is a java application developed for data curation and content preservation in Fedora-based repository systems. Content preservation and data curation in our sense include object management and creation, versioning, normalization and standards, and choice of data formats.
Cirilo makes use of Fedora’s management-API (API-M). It offers applications which are particularly prone to being used as tools for mass operations on Fedora repository objects, such as ingest or replacement processes: With Cirilo ingest processes can be performed from the file system, from an eXist database or an Excel spreadsheet. During the ingest metadata is automatically extracted from the source document and written to the newly created object (for instance in DC format).
  The client operates on a collection of predefined content models which can be used without further adjustments for standard workflow scenarios like the management of collections of TEI objects. The content models, which are based on the Fedora object model, are class definitions: On the one hand they define the (MIME-)type of the contained data streams, on the other hand they designate dissemination methods operating on these data streams. Every object in the repository is an instance of one of these class definitions. The advantage of this concept lies in the fact that very complex data sources and workflows can be handled easily.
Currently, the client offers various content models for specific purposes, special emphasis lies on the TEI model. The TEI ingest processes can be flexibly costumized: during ingest policies for the extraction of semantic information can be applied, referenced images can be uploaded simultaneously and ontology concepts can be resolved. A new content model currently in development creates the appropriate ontology objects, especially SKOS objects. A designated query object makes it possible to pose queries with parameters to the Mulgara triplestore. With the help of these ontology and query objects dynamic indices can be created. There is a container object for the creation of collections available, which makes it easy to organize your resources. Finally, there are some models optimized for specified primary sources like METS/MODS, HTML, PDF, BibTeX or external resources accessible via an URL. A content model for linguistic resources is in development (in cooperation with ICLTT, Vienna). Currently, we are testing how controlled vocabularies and thesauri (for instance geonames.org), can be sensibly integrated in the system.
The user can assign numerous virtual representations via the client. The METS/MODS object is designed to be viewed in the DFG-Viewer. TEI objects can be directly used as the input for the Voyant Tools or the Versioning Machine. The members of a context object can be projected on a map using Google Maps. Basically any web-based service can be integrated into the infrastructure. Of course, user- and project-specific stylesheets are often employed.
The Cirilo Client will be made available as an open source software project, including documentation, as a contribution of the Centre for Information Modeling - Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities to DARIAH-AT in 2014.

Introduction

The English Scientific Text Corpus (SciTex) consists of about 5000 scientific papers with about 34 Mio tokens in two time slots, 1970/80s and 2000s 1, 2. It has been compiled to investigate the construal of scientific disciplinarity, in particular, how interdisciplinary contact disciplines emerge from their seed disciplines. Both time slots consist of nine disciplines: Computer Science (A) as one seed discipline, Linguistics (C1), Biology (C2), Mechanical Engineering (C3), Electrical Engineering (C4) as the other seed disciplines, and Computational Linguistics (B1), Bioinformatics (B2), Digital Construction (B3), and Microelectronics (B4) as the corresponding contact disciplines between A and C1-C4. The individual articles are subdivided into Abstract, Introduction, Main, and Conclusion.
The orthogonal dimensions time, discipline, and logical structure provide for many, potentially interesting setups of variational analysis: We can explore the diachronic evolution of contact disciplines in comparison to their seed disciplines, variation between contact disciplines and their seed disciplines, and genre variation between abstracts and text bodies in individual disciplines. In this paper we present an approach that combines a macroanalytic perspective 3 with the more traditional microanalytic perspective served by concordance search to explore variation along these dimensions.
2. Approach

2.1. Macroanalysis

For supporting explorative macroanalysis, we use well understood visualization techniques – heatmaps and wordclouds – and combine them with intuitive exploration paradigms – drill down and side by side comparison (see Figure 1). The heatmaps and wordclouds are interactive, allowing for a closer inspection at various levels. The leftmost heatmap visualizes the highest level contrast between abstracts and text bodies in the two time slots (1970s/80s and 2000s). The middle and right heatmaps serve for inspecting a chosen contrast at a lower level at the level of individual disciplines. A particular contrast can be chosen by clicking on the respective square, numbers indicating which contrast is displayed in the middle (Selection 1) and right heatmap (Selection 2). In this example, the middle heatmap visualizes the distances between abstracts and text bodies, and the right heatmap visualizes the distances between text bodies and abstracts.
The wordclouds underneath the heatmaps display the most typical words for a chosen contrast. In Figure 1 the wordcloud to the left visualizes the most typical words for abstracts as opposed to text bodies in the 2000s. Unlike in the common use of wordclouds, the size of words is proportional to their contribution to the distance (as defined in Section 2.2), whereas relative frequency is visualized by color, ranging from purple to red.

Fig. 1: Contrast between Abstracts and Text Bodies
Having a closer look at Figure 1, we can observe that the distance between abstracts is generally larger than the distance between text bodies, and that it has increased in the 30 years period. This general trend is mirrored in the individual disciplines (not shown here). Looking at the middle and right heatmaps, we can see that - not surprisingly - the distance between particular disciplines are at a minimum (squares forming the main diagonal), and the distances among the seed disciplines (A and C corpora), are generally larger than the distances among contract disciplines.
The corresponding wordclouds visualize the most typical words for abstracts (middle heatmap) and for text bodies (right heatmap) in the discipline B1 (Computational Linguistics). In this particular contrast, words typical for abstracts are clearly centered around constructions of exposition (we propose, describe, investigate), main topics of B1 (natural, language (generation), machine translation), words describing the methodology (method, statistical, computational, system) and function words (and, of, on). Words typical for text bodies are markedly different: they comprise B1's main entities of topic elaboration (tokens, nouns, object, vp, john, probability), references (see figure, table, section), conjunctions (when, since, because, if), auxiliary and modal verbs (be, is, was, were, do, will, would, may), and prominently, the determiner the. In summary, abstracts exhibit characteristics of an informationally dense text (e.g., omission of determiners) with topic oriented content. In contrast, text bodies are less dense (determiners, references, modality) and more elaborated.
Other contrastive pairs, such as the synchronic comparison between disciplines or the diachronic comparison of the two time slots, corroborate the results derived by means of computationally much more demanding techniques from machine learning [1], [2].
2.2. Corpus Representation and Distance Measures

The individual corpora are tokenized, and tokens are transformed to lower case. Stopwords are deliberately not excluded to inspect all levels of variation: style, lexico-grammar, and theme. On this basis, corpora are represented by means of unigram language models smoothed with Jelinek-Mercer smoothing, which is a linear interpolation between the relative frequency of a word in a subcorpus and its relative frequency in the entire corpus 4. The distance between two corpora P and Q is measured by relative entropy D, also known as Kullback-Leibler Divergence:
D(P||Q)>=Sum_w p(w)*log_2(p(w)/q(w))
Here p(w) is the probability of a word w in P, and q(w) is its probability in Q. Relative entropy thus measures the average amount of additional bits per word needed to encode words distributed according to P by using an encoding optimized for Q. Note that this measure is asymmetric, i.e., D(P||Q) != D(Q||P), and has its minimum at 0 for P = Q5.
The individual word weights are calculated by the pointwise Kullback-Leibler Divergence 6:
D_w(P||Q) = p(w)*log_2(p(w)/q(w))
For all words the statistical significance of a difference is calculated based on an unpaired Welch t-test on the observed word probabilities in the individual documents of a corpus. This is used for discarding words below a given level of significance (p-value). A more detailed comparison with other measures for comparing corpora 7 is beyond the scope of this paper and will appear in another venue.
2.3. Microanalysis

Wordclouds serve as a bridge between the big distance picture of macroanalysis and microanalyis. To this end, they are seamlessly integrated with the IMS Open Corpus Workbench (CQPWeb: http://cwb.sourceforge.net/index.php), which provides for an expressive corpus query language and several summarization tools, such as collocations and comparative word frequency lists. A click on a word sends a query to CQPWeb, which returns the word in the chosen context. For example, clicking on “do” in the right heatmap (B1 (Txt00) vs. B1 (Abs00)) generates the following query shown in Figure 2.

Fig. 2: Concordance for “do” in B1, text bodies, 2000s
This query returns a concordance for “do” in the 2000s slot of SciTex constrained to subcorpus B1 and to the divisions Introduction, Main, and Conclusion. Based on this list one can inspect the larger context of individual hits and get a ranked list of collocations to distinguish the uses of “do” as an auxiliary vs. main verb.
3. Related Work

The need for combining macroanalysis with microanalysis is well recognized in the DH community 8, 9, and there does exist a variety of frameworks with similar goals. Due to space restrictions, we can only give an exemplary selection; for a comprehensive overview see TAPoR 2.0 (http://tapor.ca/). The MONK workbench 10 allows to compare pairs of corpora using Dunning's log-likelihood ratio 11 for word weighting. Apart from the different distance measure, the main difference of our approach is that we combine the macro perspective of overall distance with the micro perspective of individual word weights to allow for an explorative analysis of variation. The Voyant Tools 12 provide a plethora of text visualizations, including word clouds, cooccurrences, and word trends based on frequencies. The focus of these tools, however, lies on summarizing and visualizing one text or corpus, rather than on exploring variation among corpora. Finally, the TXM platform 13 integrates the IMS Corpus Workbench with some macroanalysis R packages such as factorial correspondence analysis, contrastive word specificity, and cooccurrence analysis. While this integration certainly provides a broader set of analysis techniques, it is arguably more complicated to use than the system presented in this paper.
4. Summary and Future Work

We have presented a system that combines macroanalysis with microanalysis to explore language variation, and briefly illustrated its use for analyzing differences along the dimensions time, discipline, and genre in a corpus of scientific text. Future work will be devoted both to technical as well as methodological enhancements. A useful technical extension is the facility to interactively group subcorpora to larger units, maybe with the help of hierarchical clustering based on the distance matrix to form meaningful groups. More generally, the support for importing external corpora and exporting distance matrices and word weights for analysis with other tools is desirable – the presented system has been evaluated based on a number of corpora, but the underlying processing pipeline certainly needs to be generalized and improved. On the methodological side the main challenge lies in supporting a broader variety of feature sets beyond simple unigram language models. This includes latent language models such as topic models 14 and hidden markov models 15, but also enriched representations such as part-of-speech tagging, and other extensions of unigram models. Such richer feature sets allow to focus analysis by means of feature selection, but also bear new challenges in measuring and visualizing the contribution of features to a contrast at hand, and translating features into meaningful queries against the underlying corpus.

Culture, Liberal Arts, and Society Scholars (CLASS) is an undergraduate research and fellowship program in the digital humanities awarded to student scholars at Hamilton College’s Digital Humanities Initiative (DHi). Basic literacies for the digital age are critical skills sets for students entering the professional world in the twenty-first century. The Digital Humanities Initiative provides new opportunities for students in the humanities to become fully engaged citizens in this ongoing digital revolution.

CLASS is based on three-broad areas of scholarly inquiry and their intersection with new and emerging digital technologies: 1) Culture, 2) Liberal Arts, and 3) Society. CLASS provides a unique partnership between departments, programs, and units across the liberal arts and humanities at Hamilton in partnership with the College’s Career Center. It begins with course connections in our Cinema and New Media Studies (CNMS) program but then removes the confines of the semester to promote deep understanding of digital humanities research within a specific field of interest. In these experiences, students and their faculty advisor become part of a collaborative working team of experts in DHi.

CLASS provides students with skills training in digital literacies through intensive research and scholarship coupled with two unique internship experiences. In the summer between sophomore and junior years CLASS offers undergraduate students an intensive professional development experience and provides a comprehensive overview of work in their respective field of interest. In the summer immediately after their junior year students enter their second internship off campus leading to employment and/or graduate study as a result of the eighteen-month program. Assistance with job placement, in a professional field, based on their CLASS internship placement, and/or graduate studies occurs in their final year at Hamilton. 


Fig. 1: Fig. 1. CLASS Program 18-month Structure

The coursework for the program begins in the fall of their sophomore year with CNMS 120 or 125 (Fig 1). In the spring semester students can enroll in courses offered in the CNMS minor. Students enroll in either CNMS 200W/Introduction to Digital Humanities or CNMS300/Interdisciplinary Research Methods that provide experiences writing grant proposals in the digital humanities.

The goals for CLASS include:

Collaboration with potential faculty and/or staff mentors to define and develop an interdisciplinary project
Writing a research proposal for their projects.
DHi committee reviews the proposals and recommend possible award opportunities.
Students begin work over a 10-week period in the summer, mid-June to late August.
A two-week intensive training program takes place in June of the first summer. Students survey mature digital humanities projects, participate in discussions of digital humanities readings, interact with invited speakers brought into the program, and explore technologies related to their research project goals. During the academic year following the first summer, students work with their mentor between 4-6 hours a week on their collaborative research project. In the summer between junior and senior years, CLASS offers undergraduate students an intensive professional development experience and provides a comprehensive overview of work in new digital technologies.

CLASS will:

Develop understanding of digital humanities methods
Develop technological expertise for careers and digital scholarship
Through their participation in an undergraduate research project, students will be able to:

Develop a research question, problem, or design;
Apply basic principles and knowledge found in the literature related to the research question;
Develop a research proposal to address or resolve a specific research question or problem;
Apply and evaluate interdisciplinary methodologies throughout the project;
Collect, interpret, and critique data in order to resolve a research question or evaluate a design;
Utilize digital skills (TEI, digital collection development, media object creation, geospatial visualization, etc.) necessary for robust digital scholarship in the humanities
Communicate research findings through oral presentations and digital publications.
Students in research collaborations with Faculty and members of the DHi, develop deep understanding of a specific long-term research agenda. They are expected to conduct collaborative investigation of a specific aspect of the research that is of great interest to them and integrate digital humanities research methods in their process. Deliverables include public presentation and/or publication at milestones in this process.

Accomplishments:
Cohort 2011

Sarah Bither and Melissa Yang worked with Professor Kyoko Omori to develop an understanding of Benshi performance art for contemporary audiences. The outcome of this work is a website, http://courses.hamilton.edu/dhi-class-1/sarah with components that will ultimately be incorporated into Professor Omori’s Japanese Comparative Literature Archive. Bither continued her study of Japanese culture and language by going abroad to Japan in the spring and summer of 2012. Randall Telfer worked with Professor Thomas Wilson to explore Confucian rituals and connections to contemporary religious practices in China. The outcomes of this work were additional edits to two of Professor Wilson’s websites http://academics.hamilton.edu/asian_studies/home/asc_test/index.html and The Cult of Confucius website: http://academics.hamilton.edu/asian_studies/home/coc_test/index.html. Brynna Tomassone worked with Professor Angel David Nieves to explore cultural connections between South Africa and the United States during the time period leading up to the events in 1976 Soweto. The outcome of this work is a series of book chapters currently in forthcoming publications including The Heritage of Iconic Planned Communities: The Challenges of Change (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2014). Tomassone is now a Ph.D. student in Hispanic/Spanish Studies at Syracuse University. 

 

Cohort 2012

Maxwell Lopez (’14) mentored by Professor Nathan Goodale. Continuing aspects of research on the history and culture of the Sinixt Nation in British Columbia, Lopez proposed to work for the 2012 -2013 year creating, “an accurate three dimensional digital representation of the British Columbia site along with some models of artifacts excavated” using the Unity game engine. He believes the project will create a “new way for people to experience and interact with history” and have great capacity for connecting with research with the public. By the end of the two- week CLASS session in June 2012, Lopez had already made several models in Blender (a 3D modeling software) and site maps in Unity (a virtual world platform for models to reside). The following is a screenshot of his initial construction of a pit house in Blender. Please see the folder on CLASS 2012 for screenshots of his work to date and his complete proposal. 


Fig. 2: Figure 2. Sinixt Ritual Pit House model (created in Blender).

Lopez continued work with Professor Nathan Goodale in GIS mapping and archeological data collection for continued development of Sinixt Ritual Pit (Fig. 2) houses at an archeology Field School in British Columbia summer 2013. Lopez has presented aspects of his work with Professor Goodale at several forums on campus in Fall 2012 and also at the 2013 Re:Humanities symposium April, 5, 2013.

Continuing aspects of O’Neill’s development of Beloved Witness: Agha Shahid Ali Archive, Ujjwal Pradham (’14) will explore the use of text analysis tools and TEI in developing aspects of the Agha Shahid Ali Archive. Pradham is also interested in establishing a connection between the archive and current communities of interest in Kashmir. 

Pradham explored the uses of social software to make connections between contemporary Kashmir communities and the developing Beloved Witness archive. The following is a screen shot of the Voyant Tools (Fig. 3) text analysis Ujjwal did to compare theme words (home, waiting, never, Spring, Kashmir) in multiple manuscripts over the development of a poem written by Ali.

Cohort 2013

Working with Religious Studies Professor Abhishek Amar on aspects of his Sacred Centers in India Project, students Kenneth Ratliff (’16) and Alex Gioia (’14), embarked on a study of Indian sacred centers -- Buddhist Bodhgaya and Hindu Gaya. The students expanded their understanding of the Indian sacred cities of Gaya and Bodhgaya. They assisted Professor Amar in organizing his research data for these two cities (images, videos, and GPS coordinates) into the metadata schema for his digital research archive. This work of organizing and processing the over 418 data objects from Gaya into survey forms conducive to further analysis is necessary for long term sustainability of the digital archive. It is also the first step in the creation of interactive models of important artifacts and their locations within these religious sites. Appendix “A” is an example of one of the individual data survey forms used in this project and is based on those used by the K.P. Jayaswal Research Institute, with whom Professor Amar collaborates. Ratliff and Gioia have already begun creating an interactive two-dimensional line map of the Vishnupada complex (Fig 4). 


Fig. 4: Figure 4. Interactive line map of Vishnupada Complex with Mahadeva site highlighted (created in Blender).

This interactive map will link to images of the sites (Fig. 5) and 3D models of the artifacts in situ (Fig. 6). They hope that these virtual 3D and geographically correct models will foster greater interest in these religious sites due to the accessibility and interactivity of the maps, photographs, models, and videos.

Ultimately, the plans are to place the models that they produce into an online viewing space, developed from a game engine (Unity), that will make the models easily viewable and web accessible to the public.

Working with Patricia O'Neill on aspects of her Beloved Witness archive, Kerri Grimaldi (’16) examined the significance of Emily Dickinson’s poetry to Agha Shahid Ali, a poet from Kashmir, whose work is the focus of the archive. Grimaldi’s project traces the depth of Emily Dickinson’s influence in Shahid’s poem, “A Nostalgist’s Map of America,” by placing Shahid’s poem side-by-side with Dickinson’s “A Route of Evanescence” in four stages of analysis, each increasing in level of explication. By analyzing Shahid’s poem, it is possible to read Dickinson’s in a completely different light, while also witnessing the resonating power of her poetry. Grimaldi has started to create a website to present her analysis of the relationship between the work of Shahid and Dickinson. Ultimately, this website will show not only that Dickinson influenced Shahid’s work, but that his work responded to and interpreted hers, such that their works are in conversation with each other. Please review the current status of this project, including the descriptive first layer of the website, the storyboards exploring intertextuality in the second layer and third layers and a draft of Grimaldi’s own creative video interpretation of the two poems in conversation. This project was submitted in September 2013 to the Dickinson Electronic Archives 2.0: CALL FOR PROPOSALS for volume 3 -- Emily Dickinson’s Reading Culture to be published in 2014. Part One of Kerri's website can be found at http://dhinitiative.org/demos/grimaldi/ 

Challenges
Initial Challenges for DHi in developing CLASS included answering, how do we publish in the digital Humanities? Much of collaborative research includes the use of copyrighted material and/or faculty research that is still in early development. These characteristics of the work in CLASS required that we reconsider the amount and type of information (public or not) conveyed to illustrate the progress of the students. We achieved our goal of facilitating discussion with other scholars in the field by including experts from across disciplines in the two-week intensive training program and through the natural association of collaborators on the faculty research projects. CLASS scholars biographies and research descriptions are announced on the DHi website. CLASS scholars give project prospectus presentations and/or example research projects at the end of their two-week training program in the first summer. These presentations and examples are given to an invited audience for feedback on the projects. Ultimately, each student presents or publishes their work off-campus. Several students have presented at Re:Humanities. 

CLASS Program Summary and Future Plans
Students in research collaborations with Faculty and members of the DHi, have been successful in developing deep understanding of a specific long-term research agenda. DHi provides the immersive experiences and ongoing continuity with faculty research necessary to support this engagement. Most of our CLASS scholars have conducted collaborative investigation of a specific aspect of a long-term research agenda, determined their specific interests and contributions to that agenda, and publicly presented their scholarship “in progress” at Hamilton events and professional conferences.

Our future plans are to continue the CLASS program and to collaborate on its development with other liberal arts schools. Several schools have asked us about building similar models at their schools. This would require thinking more about scaling-up the program. One option we are considering is a form of “Summer Institute” for undergraduates in which we bring them together with their mentors and a larger DH community for a two-week program. 

Appendix A: Proof of Concept for a Sustainable Digital Humanities Faculty Collection Infrastructure in the Liberal Arts. 


DHi’s technology infrastructure and research support model is designed to be sustainable. That is, our approach will reduce the need for regular revamping of static faculty research web pages by creating infrastructure and processes that maintain research outcomes as “living” web presences accessible for faculty and student collaborative scholarship over time. To this end we researched best practices in digital collection development and preservation in collaboration with members of our library and decided to develop an institutional warehouse (repository) for digital collections (Fedora Commons). Fedora was chosen for its scalability and ability to be extremely flexible in the way objects can be accessed. Fedora has built-in flexibility to allow creation and maintenance of relationships among objects and across digital collections over time.

After researching open source collaborative tools to interface with collections in Fedora Commons we decided to make use of Islandora. Islandora can be used to create customized themes for faculty collections and projects. Our DHi Collection Development Team is working with the Islandora and Fedora Commons consultants (at Discovery Garden to create our digital scholarship infrastructure. By using experts to help with development we are making efficient use of the Mellon Grant to move this complex project forward.

1. Vishnu, 16'' (122)

2. Camunda, 16'' (120, 121)

There's no logic to the temple - they have plastered images all over the place; normally, you would not see Bishnu and Camunda next to each other, but in this case we do, in a disorganized fashion. For instance, they are in the same niche, but Camunda is platered higher than Vishnu, which speaks to the disorganization of the collection process.

1984,2014 - Lausanne,Lausanne,Digital Cultural Empowerment,2014-01-01T00:00:00Z,ADHO,ADHO,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL);Université de Lausanne,Lausanne,,Switzerland,https://web.archive.org/web/20161227182033/https://dh2014.org/program/,Leaves of Grass: Data Animation and XML Technologies,,Brett Barney;Brian Pytlik-Zillig,"paper, specified ""long paper""","Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass is one of the most famous and often-studied works of American literature. In the century since Van Wyck Brooks declared Whitman the originator of “the sense of something organic in American life”—the first to combine high art and rude experience—Whitman’s masterwork has been thoroughly digested into a series of critical truisms that gives even new readers of the poems a sense of familiarity. Whether we have his poems committed to memory or have never actually read one of them, we “all know” that Whitman eschewed traditionally poetic diction, that his is a poetry of inclusiveness, that the first edition of his text in 1855 is more daring, lively, and experimental than later editions, etc. 

Such axioms are comforting in the face of what is on many levels a difficult text (actually, a set of texts) to assimilate. Because Whitman applied the title “Leaves of Grass” to more than ten distinctly different volumes over the course of three and a half decades—not only adding poems but also retitling, cancelling, drastically revising, combining, and re-grouping existing ones—the goal of accurately tracing the book’s evolution has consistently frustrated scholars. Recognizing that “for the reader to understand how Leaves of Grass grew from edition to edition, some sense had to be made of these often bewildering textual permutations,” a group of late-twentieth century scholars labored for over a decade to produce a variorum edition, a tremendous accomplishment that has, unfortunately, done little to alleviate the bewilderment of permutations. 

The hope that digital technologies might offer a way, at last, to lucidly represent the various stages in the evolution of Leaves of Grass was one of the early motivations for the creators of the Whitman Archive in the late 1990s. We have often revisited the question of how to convey visually the information represented in the arcane coding of the 3-volume print variorum and inherent in the separate digitized editions. Nearly two decades later, however, we haven’t made much progress. 

Though they cannot provide the kind of detailed, objective understanding that might be conveyed by the schematic, interactive interfaces that we’ve sometimes (very hazily) imagined—ones that somehow collate whole texts, poems, lines, and phrases—we have begun to experiment with distant reading strategies that provide a different sort of view. So while collation tools do not cope well with the scope of transformation involved in Whitman’s reworking the first edition’s 10,000-word prose preface into the 4,000-word poem “By Blue Ontario’s Shore,” text analysis tools such as Voyant offer a number of potentially enlightening prospects on the two works and their relationship. 

Likewise, such tools can begin to offer ways to assay and quantify some of the critical commonplaces that have grown up around Leaves of Grass: Is Whitman’s diction, in fact, innovative and what makes it so? How do Whitman’s early poems compare to his later poems? What basis might be found for claims that Whitman is the great poet of America, women, the body, male homoeroticism, or democracy?

At the University of Nebraska–Lincoln's Center for Digital Research in the Humanities we have been experimenting with a new way of visualizing phenomena in TEI corpora and have created Indigo, an experimental XSLT-based tool that queries TEI files and generates animated videos of the results. Using XPath and XQuery techniques, this tool makes it possible to ask specific or general questions of a corpus. The data are then output as scalable vector graphic (SVG) files that are converted to raster images and rendered in high definition H.264 video at 30 frames per second. At its core, Indigo is a program for performing scripted stop-motion animation, arranged in one or more scenes. What each scene contains is up to the user: it might include letters, numbers, shapes, colors, gradients, patterns, lines, paths, or imported raster images, each moving or not moving. The only requirement is that a scene must be modeled in XSLT, with SVG structures as the initial output. For the user wishing to visualize aspects of TEI text corpora, the news is good, for that format shares membership with XSLT and SVG in the XML ecosystem. Indigo provides a method for presenting, in fresh and unexpected ways, quantitative data relevant to scholarly questions in a way that is open-ended, making the user a co-creator with Whitman in the “meaning” of his texts. 

Our experiment involves such activities as creating quantitive analyses of some of the linguistic characteristics of Whitman's poetic corpus, comparing them to those of some of his popular contemporaries, and then ""presenting"" the results as a video sequence. Such a procedure is admittedly outside the mainstream of critical methodology in the humanities, but it is entirely in keeping with Whitman’s own theories of the proper relationships among authors, readers, and texts. “The process of reading,” he said, “is not a half-sleep, but, in highest sense, an exercise, a gymnast’s struggle; . . . the reader is to do something for himself, . . . must himself or herself construct indeed the poem, argument, history, metaphysical essay—the text furnishing the hints, the clue, the start or frame-work.”1

As Tanya Clement has recently observed, ""sometimes the view facilitated by digital tools generates the same data human beings . . . could generate by hand, but more quickly,"" and sometimes ""these vantage points are remarkably different . . . and provide us with a new perspective on texts.""2 And as Dana Solomon has written, ""due in large part to its often powerful and aesthetically pleasing visual impact, relatively quick learning curve … and overall 'cool,' the practice of visualizing textual data has been widely adopted by the digital humanities.""3

In representing the literary work as an absorbing performance, one that comprises both ""data"" and ""art,"" the method we are presenting is calculated to provoke responses in both informational and aesthetic registers. It is, in the terms of Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels, an act of “interpretive deformance,” whereby “we are brought to a critical position in which we can imagine things about the text that we didn’t and perhaps couldn’t otherwise know.”4

This scholarly role is becoming increasingly important to new forms of knowledge dissemination as a result of the growth in aggregating or mashing up existing digital content. The goal of these aggregations is to add value for particular purposes, as seen in initiatives such as the Journal of Digital Humanities, which aims to collect already published materials into quarterly thematic collections, and the related website Digital Humanities Now, which curates weekly the feeds of other digital humanities websites (Digital Humanities Now).

By analogy with the definition of a curator as “The officer in charge of a museum, gallery of art, library, or the like; a keeper, custodian” (“curator,” def. n. 6), the digital scholarly curator performs a similar role with respect to the circulation of digital content, though with a number of significant differences. Gallery or museum curators, for instance, have their own scholarly and professional training and preparation, often with respect to proper handling and display of fine art and other valuable physical objects. There are those who feel that at least some curators should be considered artists themselves (e.g. Ventzislavov). There is also widespread acknowledgment that curators who work with digital materials require a different set of competencies. Melody Madrid, for example, reports a study that resulted in a list of 20, divided into the categories operational and managerial. Digital scholarly curation also harnesses social media technologies (e.g. crowdsourcing, folksonomies) to encourage a new level of user participation in the management and preservation of digital content (Poole). Not quite an editor, but acting as a mediator between the producers of these contents and its audience through such activities as selecting and reframing them, the digital scholarly curator is in a rather unique position. Our discussion considers this role in relation to the Dynamic Table of Contexts (DToC) interface, a generalized tool for the dissemination of digital text that enables the designer of the collection to mediate specifically between the XML encoding of the text and the affordances that such encoding provides in the reading interface (Brown et al.; Dobson et al.).

The Dynamic Table of Contexts (Fig 1) is a joint initiative between the Interface Design research team of the Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE) project, the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC), the University of Alberta Press, and the Voyant Tools project. The DToC currently leverages four principal components of a digital text: the actual text of the document, a table of contents, an index, and XML encoding of the document. The goal of the prototype is to provide an online reading environment where the table of contents provides a conventional overview of a book while at the same time incorporating the index terms and XML tags and the text to which they point (Ruecker et al.). The terms and tags can be selected and deselected, providing interactivity between these three means for accessing and navigating the content of the text or collection.


Fig. 1: Dynamic Table of Contexts Interface

The ability to leverage XML markup as part of the navigational interface is a distinguishing feature of the DToC. Customization of that affordance is enabled by what we call the DToC’s “curator mode,” which is distinct from the reading mode in that it allows technically adept superusers to create customized tag lists to serve as navigational aids alongside the index terms, as well as to determine the organization of the table of contents (login is not required, the curated view is expressed through a unique URL). In a print edition, and in particular for anthologies, it is necessary for the editor to decide which of the various alternatives will be used to organize a particular table of contents. For example, a collection of essays might be organized

alphabetically by title
alphabetically by author’s last name
chronologically
by theme
or by some other principle, in order to ensure a certain kind of development or coherence from beginning to end.
A collection of poems, for example, might add organization alphabetically by the first line of the poem, for cases where the poems do not have a title, and other arrangements are also possible, for instance by geographic location, language, or genre. In the case of an instructor preparing a course pack, the arrangement would naturally correspond to the sequence in which the materials will be used in the class. In the history of print, the possibilities for multiple representation of contents were limited.

In addition to the selection and organization of the contents themselves, curators of DToC collections need to make choices with respect to how the encoding works in the interface. Given the more generic and multi-purpose nature of XML encoding, particularly its use to structure a text, curators need to select which tags the DToC interface will display to the reader, and what user-friendly labels to use for those tags. For many purposes (although not all), the structural encoding can be set aside in favor of semantic encoding (when present). For choices among these tags, there is probably some golden mean that’s most appropriate for generic use; the primary benefit of the Dynamic Table of Contexts is to allow variants for more specific uses. Tags that have been rarely used may already be covered by the index, or may be too insignificant to take room on the list. On the other hand, in cases where the tags have been used heavily enough, it may not be useful to include them since it would result in too great a density of hits.

There are also large differences between what kind of curation of tags is required – depending on whether a schema or tagset has instead been applied throughout a collection, such as in the Brown Women Writers Project’s use of the Text Encoding Initiative – as opposed to highly customized versions of the TEI adapted to the needs of a particular text. Finally, the curator is also enabled to label how tags will appear in the interface, so that readers are not asked to decipher cryptic forms such as <biblStruct>, but are instead presented with labels for such tags that are meaningful in the context for which the curated text or collection is being prepared. This functionality is useful in cases where there is a nuanced difference between two similar tags that needs to be conveyed to the readers (Fig 2).


Fig. 2: Dynamic Table of Contents Curator Interface

What this means in terms of the training and qualifications of the DToC curator is that the person needs to hypothesize how the target readers will be dealing with the material, and to use the curatorial functions to customize the view of the text in the DToC interface to meet the anticipated use case(s). In the case of class instructors, to a certain extent the job will be simplified since the course pack has been chosen purposively for the class. In other situations, there may be multiple and possibly conflicting anticipated use cases. The curator also needs to be comfortable enough with XML not only to choose appropriate tags and rename them, but also, if needed, to specify XPath queries to locations in the document that cannot be identified through tag names alone. There will be considerable variation in XML expertise amongst curators, and a previous user study of ours on an earlier version of DToC indicated that a closer relationship to the encoding correlated with more positive experiences of the DToC interface (Dobson et al.).

The paper will frame our understanding of digital scholarly curation in relation to more traditional, historical understandings of curation and representation of contents and will demonstrate the curator mode in the DToC interface. Our previous user studies of the interface found both considerable confusion on the part of users with respect to the role of the encoding or tagging in the DToC (Brown et al.), and, among those who understood it, considerable emphasis on the importance of the XML markup and its ability to shape the reader experience in the interface. As one user said in mousing over the XML Markup pane: “Well, this seems to me the most relevant section, so whoever puts that together is pretty much the wizard in this Oz” (Dobson et al.). Our discussion will incorporate results of the next user study we are conducting on the DToC, with a stress on the curator mode, that will probe these findings which go to the heart of the DToC’s affordances. Our aim will be to gain a fuller understanding of the ways in which users with a range of technical knowledge understand the role of markup in the DToC interface, and their understanding as both readers and curators of the curatorial role. This study will inform our understanding not only of the ways in which reading environments such as the DToC can effectively leverage XML encoding, but more generally of the ways in which the idea of curation is rapidly evolving within the online scholarly environment.

Literary scholars are increasingly turning to graphical display of humanistic information as a way to encounter texts in new and engaging ways. Digitally facilitated humanities visualization presents literary critics with opportunities for new insight1, while also opening practitioners to charges of wholesale importation of simplistic scientific methodologies.2 This poster session outlines the rationale, method, and significance of a focused humanities visualization project in order to demonstrate how new techniques of visualization may be undertaken with literary texts to produce new and speculative “aesthetic provocations” in literary studies.3

Materials and Scope
In order to model and theorize how such a project might develop, I am producing a network visualization of the sixteenth-century play Ralph Roister Doister by Nicholas Udall. Using the open-source ""interactive visualization and exploration"" platform Gephi, I map the relationships between characters in the play based upon dialogue. In other words, this project structurally maps dialogue between characters, producing a network visualization that productively reconfigures the play to provoke new analytical responses. Following the example of Franco Moretti’s work with Hamlet, these models prompt new insight into the “deep structures” of literary works. For Moretti, however, “the most important thing of all” about these reconfigurations is that they can be manipulated: “one can intervene on a model; make experiments.”4 [116, italics in original]. With a baseline visualization of dialogue established, I, following Jerome McGann, selectively intervene and “deform” the re-modeled text to continually reconfigure it. Such processes bring us “to a critical position in which we can imagine things about the texts that we didn’t and perhaps couldn’t otherwise know.”5 [116] Motivated by Drucker and Nowviskie’s call to “engage computing to produce new aesthetic provocations,” I use Roister Doister to understand how humanities visualization may reconfigure our approach to literary inquiry.6 

Methods of Production
In order to map the dialogic relationships between these characters in Gephi, I have created each character as a node in the network; these nodes are connected by directional dialogue originating at a particular node and terminating at another. Thus, the main characters Roister Doister and Merygreeke are nodes 1.0 and 2.0, for example. Within Gephi’s data manipulation environment, a line of dialogue from the former to the latter would be mapped visually as a line [or an “edge”] from node 1.0 to node 2.0. Each exchange is recorded as tabled data in Gephi, which is then used to produce visualizations. Visualizations can be produced for any discrete unit of the text, including scene, act, or the entirety of the play. This project produces visualizations of each of these divisions for comparative purposes. Following Moretti and McGann, I have undertaken selective deformations by, for example, removing various characters at different points, thereby revealing their network centrality. Criticism of Roister Doister has, for the most part, focused heavily on the play’s dramaturgical debt to the classical comedies of Terence and Plautus, the extent to which those formal structures were successfully integrated with “native” elements of English drama, and the play’s debts to the miles gloriosus [“braggart-soldier”] tradition of Classical comedy.78 This project is in part an attempt to revitalize an ossified critical conversation as an example of how new techniques can vigorously re-engage old texts. 

Significance of Anticipated Visualizations
Experimentation in visualization of textual works is a timely one. As can be seen from the growing use of the Voyant suite9 of analysis and visualization tools as well as the popular Mapping the Republic of Lettersproject,10 humanities visualization is a growing area of scholarly concern. Elijah Meeks has argued that “the shift from creating, annotating and analyzing archives to modeling systems can have a profound impact beyond the [admittedly high value of] usability of scholarly material developed during a digital humanities project.”11 [italics mine]. When humanities scholars have reached a certain point of visual literacy, we will begin to engage with such models in profoundly important ways. Indeed, these models may “provide a much more nuanced form of knowledge transmission than the raw datasets or interactive and dynamic applications typically presented as the future of digital scholarly media.”12 This project is an effort to explore how these new forms of knowledge transmission and analysis might impact literary inquiry.

They sail not on seas of water but on seas of color, sound, and, most especially, words.” — John B. Smith, 1984

Why is big data such a big deal? Modern digital communications are producing and recording data at a feverish rate, with 90% of the world’s recorded data, most of it unstructured, having been produced in just the last two years (Dragland, 2013). In addition, more traditional texts are being digitized all the time, and Crane (2006) tells us that while the largest academic digital libraries now hold tens of thousands of books, a completed Google Library will likely have more than ten million. To further Smith’s analogy, we are adrift in a sea of data, and we are at risk of floundering.

Front page news events like Edward Snowden’s May 2013 revelations disclosing the secret NSA (America’s National Security Agency) collection and analysis of massive amounts of ostensibly private data both domestically and internationally, are making big data analytics part of the public lexicon.  Major corporations, led by IBM with $1.3 billion in big data revenue in 2012, are scrambling to adopt practices that will allow them to capitalize on the volume of information now being generated.  Global big data related revenues in 2012 were $11.6 billion, and are projected to break $18 billion in 2013 (Kelly et al.).

While one might shudder to think what the NSA will do with all that information, outside of the world of politics and espionage, what can researchers and academics do with the volume of information now, or at least soon to be at our disposal? Matthew Jockers asks, “How do we mine them [texts] to find something we don’t already know?” (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) To utilize such massive corpora and avoid succumbing to the dilemma of what McCormick et al (1987) refer to as “information without interpretation” we need to find the most effective ways for end-users to explore, visualize and interact with big data such that it is both meaningful and understandable, if possible by both the trained and untrained eye. 

Big data analytics and computer-supported visualization offer ways to read collections as our cognitive abilities are stretched to their limit with the sheer volume of data available (Araya, 2003). However, as Franco Moretti has pointed out, what we are reading when we use text mining methods and visualizations are really models of the collections. (Moretti 2013, p. 157) It is important therefore to survey the visual models emerging and question if they can better be designed to suit humanities exploration. In this paper we therefore propose to look at visualization for text mining in the following ways:

Survey text mining visualization in the humanities. Who is using text mining and why? What kinds of visualizations do they find compelling and why?
Identify and Combine commonly presented visualizations for modeling. What visual models could be used for the exploration of large corpora? How could they be combined?  
Model interactive prototypes of different combinations of visualizations for exploration. 
Surveying: In a poster at DH 2013 we presented a framework of text mining tools that are useful in the humanities. Now we will survey the variety of visualizations used to present mining results. We will begin with early discussions of visualization like Smith’s “Computer Criticism” (Style 1978, p. 326), where he notes with agreement Paul de Man’s observation that as late as 1973 there had been no evolution beyond the close reading “techniques of description and interpretation” being used by literary critics since the 1930s or 40s, and suggests “pictorial representation” as one of the potential uses of computer aided text analysis. Brunet in a 1989 article talks about exploiting large corpora and provides a number of examples of visualizations. Our survey will examine advances in practice and understanding in the intervening thirty plus years, leading to contemporary works like Franco Moretti’s Graphs, Maps, and Trees, which, as the title suggests, introduces visual models for literary exploration.

Our survey pays particular attention to recent text mining projects and tools including “The Proceedings of the Old Bailey”, David L. Hoover’s work with cluster analyses at NYU using “MiniTab”, Matt Jockers’ topic modeling work in “Macroanalysis”, the University of Waikato’s “WEKA”, the open-source visualization tool “Gephi”, the UMass machine learning tool “MALLET”, the research tools for textual study reviewed on “TAPoR”as well as some of our own INKE related projects such as “Dynamic Table of Contents”, “CiteLens”, “TextTiles” and “dialR”. 

Identifying and Combining: While we recognize that output will assume a variety of formats including for instance heat maps, topographic plots or scatter plots, our survey suggests that text-mining projects commonly use five principal types of visualization:

1. Dendrograms, showing data clustering within sets
2. Histograms, showing change over time
3. Networkdiagrams, showing how entities are connected within a network
4. Wordclouds, representing topics of words
5. Scatterplots, showing words or parts in an abstract space
Visualizations that are presented in print are typically Spartan, focusing the attention on the results through careful design. All affordances are removed. The same types of visualizations automatically generated from large data sets, however, tend to be too dense to be useful and have to include affordances if meant to be interactive. Simple representative visualizations, like histograms for instance, are insufficient to display complex interrelationships. Dendrograms, especially if you are working with massive data sets, quickly become an illegible mass of inter-connectivity. Word clouds are good at showing the relative frequency of words in a text or topic, but not at comparing one text or topic to another. Network diagrams produce some beautiful results, but suffer from the same difficulties as dendrograms; large data sets quickly lead to illegibility.

“By visualizing information, we turn it into a landscape that you can explore with your eyes, a sort of information map. And when you’re lost in information, an information map is kind of useful.” — David McCandless, 2010

Modeling: Our research now is looking at ways to increase the exploratory power of visualization of large data sets. Used in combination, visualizations can provide otherwise elusive insight and clarity. They can also provide affordances for each other – a histogram can be used to explore a dendrogram. We have developed interactive prototypes using combinations of visualizations, and focusing on not simply allowing, but even encouraging the user to truly explore the (big) data, “function[ing] almost instinctively”, as McCullough (1996) stated, “to serve the process of development”. The more we can encourage users to explore and play with the data, the more likely they are to develop useful insights.


Fig. 1: Combination of a modified dendrogram showing clustering, and a diachronic timeline of 500 philosophy papers.

Figure 1 shows a prototype of a combination of dendrogram and histogram that we developed to visualize the clustering of 500 papers published between 1966 and 2004. The prototype is a combination of a modified dendrogram showing the clusters, and a diachronic visualization displaying the subjects over time. The displayed data is intuitively explorable, and the modified dendrogram is designed to encourage exploration. We developed the R code to prepare the data for interactivity. In Voyant we have developed skins that combine scatter plots and histograms, word clouds and histograms, and network diagrams with other tools. Again, the tools are open for others to recombine.

To conclude, surveying commonly used graphical representations allowed us to identify commonly used visualizations that humanists find useful. To scale these so that they can be used interactively to explore large data sets we have prototyped combinations, where one visualization can be used to explore another and vice versa. The goal is visualizations that help researchers make sense of big data; visualizations that let us explore the forest, not just the trees so that we can draw accurate and appropriate inferences from the data.

What did humanities computing developers think they were addressing with now dated technologies like punch cards, printed concordances and verbose command languages? Whether the analytic functionality is at the surface, as with Voyant Tools, or embedded at deeper levels, as with the Lucene-powered searching and browsing capabilities of the Old Bailey, the web-based text analysis tools that we use today are very different from the first tentative technologies developed by computing humanists. Following Siegfried Zieliniski's exploration of forgotten media technologies, this paper will look at three forgotten text analysis technologies and how they were introduced by their developers at the time. Specifically we will:

Discuss why is it important to recover forgotten tools and the discourse around these instruments,
Look at how punch cards were used in Roberto Busa’s Index Thomisticus project as a way of understanding data entry,
Look at Glickman’s ideas about custom card output from PRORA, as a way of recovering the importance of output,
Discuss the command language developed by John Smith for interacting with ARRAS, and
Conclude with a more general call for digital humanities archaeology. 
Zieliniski and Media Archaeology
Siegfried Zielinski, in Deep Time of the Media, argues that technology does not evolve smoothly and that we therefore need to look at periods of intense development and then look at the dead ends that get overlooked to understand the history of media technology. In particular he shows how important it is to look at technologies that are not in canonical histories as precursors to “successful” technologies, because they provide insight into the thinking at the time. A study of forgotten technologies can help us understand opportunities and challenges as they were perceived at the time and on their own terms rather than imposing our prejudices. From the 1950s until the early 1990s there was just such a period of technology development around mainframe and personal computer text analysis tools. The tools developed, the challenges they addressed, and the debates around these technologies have largely been forgotten in an age of web-mediated digital humanities. For this reason we recover three important mainframe projects that can help us understand how differently data entry, output and interaction were thought through before born- digital content, output to wall-sized screens, and interaction on a touchscreen. 

Busa and Tasman on Literary Data Processing 
The first case study we will present is about the methods that Father Busa and his collaborator Paul Tasman developed for the Index Thomisticus (Busa could hardly be considered a forgotten figure, but he's often referred to metonymically as a founder of the field, with relatively little attention paid to the specifics of his work and his collaborations). Busa, when reflecting back on the project justified his technical approach as supporting a philological method of research aimed at recapturing the way a past author used words, much as we want to recapture past development. He argued in 1980 that, “The reader should not simply attach to the words he reads the significance they have in his mind, but should try to find out what significance they had in the writer’s mind.” (Busa 1980, p. 83) Concordances could help redirect readers towards the “verbal system of an author” or how the author used words in their time and away from the temptation to interpret the text at hand using contemporary conceptual categories. Concording creates a new text that shows the verbal system, not the doctrine.

Busa’s collaborator Paul Tasman, however, presents a much more prosaic picture of their methodology that focuses on data entry using punch cards so you can actually get concordances of words. He published a paper in 1957 on “Literary Data Processing” in the IBM Journal of Research and Development that focuses on how they prepared their texts accounting for human error and other problems. Tasman writes, “It is evident, of course, that the transcription of the documents in these other fields necessitates special sets of ground rules and codes in order to provide for information retrieval, and the results will depend entirely upon the degree and refinement of coding and the variety of cross referencing desired.” (p. 256) This case study takes us back to a forgotten set of problems (representing text using punch cards) which led to more mature issues in text encoding. In the full presentation we will look closely at the data entry challenges faced by Busa’s team and how they were resolved with the card technology of the time. 

Glickman and Stallman on Printed Interfaces
The second case study we will look at is the development of the PRORA programs at the University of Toronto in the 1960s. PRORA was reviewed in the first issue of CHUM and with the publication of the Manual for the Printing of Literary Texts and Concordances by Computer by the University of Toronto Press in 1966 is one of the first academic analytical tools to be formally published in some fashion. What is particularly interesting, for our purposes, is the discussion in the Manual of how concordances might be printed. Glickman had idiosyncratic ideas about how concordances could be printed as cards for 2-ring binders so that they could be taken out and arranged on a table by users. He was combining binder technology with computing to reimagine the concordance text. Today we no longer think about output to paper as important to tools, and yet that is what the early tools were designed to do as they were not interactive. We will use this case study to recover what at the time was one of the most important features of a concording tool – how it could output something that could be published for others to use.

Smith and Interaction
One of the first text analysis tools designed to support interactive research was John Smith’s ARRAS. In ARRAS Smith developed a number of ideas about analysis that we now take for granted. ARRAS was interactive in the sense that it was not a batch program that you ran for output. It could generate visualizations and it was explicitly designed to be part of a multi-tasking research environment where you might be switching back and forth between analysis and word processing. Many of these ideas influenced the interactive PC concordancing tools that followed like TACT. In this paper, however, we are not going to focus on all the prescient features of ARRAS, but look at the now rather dated command language which Smith was so proud of. Almost no one uses a command language for text analysis any more; we expect our tools to have graphical user interfaces that provide affordances for direct manipulation. If you need to do something more than what Voyant, Tableau, Lucene, Gephi or Weka let you do, then you learn to program in a language like R or Python. John Smith by contrast, spent a lot of time trying to design a natural command language for ARRAS that humanists would find easy to use and this comes through in his publications on the tool (1984 & 1985). Command languages were, for a while, the way you interacted with such systems and attention to their design could make a difference. Smith tried to develop a command language that was conversational so humanists could learn to use it to explore “vast continents of literature or history or other realms of information, much as our ancestors explored new lands.” (Smith 1984, p. 31) Close commanding for distant reading. 

Conclusions
In the 2013 Busa Award lecture Willard McCarty called us to look to our history and specifically to look at the “incunabular” years before the web when humanists and artists were imagining what could be done. One challenge we face in reanimating this history is that so much of the story is in tools, standards and web sites – instruments difficult to interrogate the way we do texts. This paper looks back at one major thread of development - text analysis tools – not for the entertainment of outdated technology, but recover a way of thinking about technology. We will conclude by discussing other ways back including the need for better documentation about past tools, along the lines of what TAPoR 2.0 is supporting, and the need to preserve tools or at least a record of their usage.

Indeed the terms 'model' and 'modeling' seem almost painfully polysemous. Nevertheless within Digital Humanities we cannot ignore the terms or the concepts behind them—the notions are inextricably linked to what is one of the core objectives of humanities computing2, namely to render humanities data computationally tractable3 and processable45 to enhance our abilities for analysis. 
In light of the renewed debate on modeling in Digital Humanities6 this panel proposes to investigate how humanists currently understand the role and meaning of modeling, and how we may arrive at an understanding of the term appropriate for humanities research and pedagogy.
McCarty stated a decade ago that the humanities lack a disciplined way of talking about modeling7 which makes it extremely difficult to define the properties and uses of appropriate models for humanities research. Modeling is a commonplace implicit activity in digital humanities, yet our modeling activities are almost never explicitly discussed as such, and it is rarely pointed out that many of our results are in fact models: charts, probabilistic methods, interfaces to the information we structure in databases. This implicitness is attested by our language use. We do not speak of ""modeling an analogy"" or of ""modeling a chart"". We ""make"" or ""create"" them as concrete representations of an implicit and abstract model.
Yet, given the concrete applications and results that can already be seen within the humanities, modeling needs to be a humanities praxis to the same extent as it already is in other scientific fields such as biology and physics. As the social sciences –more specifically the ethnography practices in Science & Technology Studies for instance– show us, praxis by definition can be studied and interrogated for its properties by observing and following its practitioners8. This panel provides a first step in such observant interrogation. 
In the computational domain modeling can be delineated in a narrow mathematical sense where model theory9 defines Turing complete languages as models or instantiations of logic constructed from formulas (i.e. syntax or rules) and signatures (i.e. vocabulary or objects). Thus, computer languages are themselves mathematical models of logic. They provide a layer of expressive logic that in turn allows us to compositionally model data, objects and their relations10. Analogous to the statement made by Peter Robinson about interfaces11, we can argue that such a composition or model expresses an intellectual argument about the real world entities and relations they mimic, capture, or simulate—an intellectual argument that is made on several levels through the computational model and that eventually is communicated to an observer (or user) by way of its interface.
In recent years we find most notably the application of modeling in order to create maps, graphs, trees1213, analogies, diagrams, charts, simulations14, and stylometric analyses15, as well as in discourse analysis, topic modeling, and narrative modeling16. If the successful computational analytical models are quantitatively and statistically founded, does that mean that humanities modeling must necessarily be anchored in the somewhat narrowly defined models that are generally associated with quantification and computer science
More generally, must the concepts of ‘model’ and ‘modeling’ appropriate for Digital Humanities be bound solely by parameters of the mathematical foundations of binary logic? Modeling as activity and concept applies more widely to the humanities than merely in its computational applications. Is it possible to turn around the dynamic of the computational 'stack', so that rather than having mathematics drive humanities computability, the properties of humanistic problems and the data behind them might drive models of computation? We can argue that the goal of any computational approach within the humanities is to render computable the complexity, the abstraction, the ambiguity, the subjectivity, and multiplicity of perspective of the humanities17. Similarly: how do we encompass aspects of modeling present in simulation and (serious) gaming18 of which the humanistic aspects seem to transcend the narrow mathematical connotation of ‘model’? And how does modeling relate to the continuing history of developing and redeveloping digital humanities tools that–rather than merely representing infrastructure–creates a record of intellectual theorizing humanistic computational models?19 How do we break out of the mathematical sandbox defined by first-order logic to do justice to the modalities of humanities? Does this require completely new models for data, logic, and representation? Does it require a general theory of modeling? Even a new symbolic language inspired by the humanities?
This panel brings together some of the most visible practitioners of computational methods within the humanities who have captured analytic models in software code, as well as some of the most influential figures of what might be called 'tacit modeling theory in digital humanities'. We invite them to consider the characteristics of humanities modeling and how those contrast with computational modeling and mathematical modeling, so as to determine what idiosyncrasies modeling might have in a humanities domain. Do these idiosyncrasies allow us to delineate a computationally tractable vocabulary at all? To investigate these questions the panel will discuss and reflect on matters such as…
How do we address the role of modeling and models in the humanities?
How do we ensure that existing mathematical logic does not confine our ability to represent and manipulate humanistic evidence?
What benefits does a definition of modeling appropriated for the humanities hold?
What would a symbolic language for the humanities look like?
What are the standards of evaluation in modeling and do we need specific ones in the Humanities?
What is a useful vocabulary to talk about modeling in a humanities sense?

Joris van Zundert (Chair) is in charge of methodological research at the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands. Next to his research in computational humanities he is interested in exchanges between digital humanities and science and technology studies (STS).
Tara L. Andrews has implemented a digital workbench for the fully computational stemmatic analysis of text traditions (http://www.digitalbyzantinist.org/2012/09/announcing-stemmaweb.html). As an assistant professor of digital humanities she is currently developing and teaching a curriculum that emphasizes modeling and algorithmic approaches to humanistic analysis
Johanna Drucker vehemently called attention to the properties of humanities data that are normally neglected by mathematical and conventional computational models and analyses. She has argued that all data are in fact capta and that naïve approaches to statistics are at risk of defining all data as intrinsically quantitative

            <p>Our proposed paper will provide an overview of the theory and methodology driving the creation of Distant Reading Early Modernity (DREaM), a digital humanities project that has made a massive corpus of early modern texts amenable for use with macro-scale analytical tools. Key focus areas include the technical challenges deriving from non-standardized spelling, the philosophy of our tutorial program, the argument for our approach to the early modern archive, and the potential benefit to early modern scholarship of distant reading techniques. </p>
            <p>From Microfilm Library, to EEBO, to EEBO-TCP, to DREaM </p>
            <p>The foundational work for DREaM began in 1934, when Eugene B. Power used parts of two movie and still cameras to create one of the world’s first microfilm bookcameras, a device he used to photograph thousands of texts in British libraries (Anderson and Power, 1990). In 1998 Power’s microfilm library became the basis for Early English Books Online (EEBO), a database that comprises the images for some 125,000 texts from 1475 to 1700, and has profoundly expanded the horizons of early modern research.
                <hi rend=""superscript"">1</hi> To date, approximately one-third of the documents on EEBO are available as transcribed, full-text editions. Researchers for the EEBO Text Creation Partnership (EEBO-TCP) are currently working to transcribe the remaining 85,000 documents, which are as yet only available as digitized microfilm images.
                <hi rend=""superscript"">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although completion of the transcription work is still at least 10 years in the future, the prospect of a full-text library of all documents from the first 225 years of English print points to the need for some careful re-thinking about the relation between scholarship and archival sources. As it now stands, the EEBO-TCP corpus amounts to 8.02 gigabytes of XML-encoded text and contains nearly 45,000 documents, for a grand total of well over a billion words (1,155,264,343 by our count). Confronted by the sheer expanse of a corpus several magnitudes larger than anything one could hope to read in a lifetime, early modern scholarship must now work to incorporate digital methodologies that enable a bird’s-eye view of large corpora, an approach that Franco Moretti has dubbed ‘distant reading’ (Moretti, 2007). DREaM has begun the work of making such a view possible. </p>
            <p>Unlike EEBO, DREaM enables batch downloading of custom-defined subsets rather than obliging users to download individual texts on a one-by-one basis. In other words, it functions at the level of ‘sets of texts’ (sometimes called 
                <hi rend=""italic"">worksets</hi>) rather than ‘individual texts’. Examples of subsets one might potentially generate include ‘all texts by Ben Jonson’, ‘all texts published in 1623’, or ‘all texts printed by John Wolfe’. A user-friendly interface makes subsets available as either plain text or XML-encoded files, and gives users the option to automatically name individual files by date, author, title, or combinations thereof (this file naming flexibility can be useful when interoperating with other tool suites). 
            </p>
            <p>The ability to generate custom-defined subsets is important because it allows researchers to explore the early modern canon with distant reading techniques, and to capture otherwise intractable data with visualizations such as graphs, charts, or other forms of graphic representation. On this note, another key feature of DREaM is that it allows users to transfer specially tailored subsets directly to the analytic interfaces of Voyant Tools (voyant-tools.org), a suite of textual visualization tools that collectively constitute the leading platform for open-access digital humanities research.
                <hi rend=""superscript"">3</hi> In fact, DREaM is actually implemented within Voyant Tools (version 2.0, not yet released, which provides much better support for very large text collections). DREaM thus provides a compelling example of a bridge between massive full-text repositories (that typically provide faceted searching) and more specialized analytic and visualization environments. By enabling simple transference between the EEBO-TCP archive and Voyant, DREaM has significantly expanded the range and sophistication of technologies currently available to researchers who wish to gain a broad sense of printed matter in early modern England. 
            </p>
            <p>Notably, however, DREaM does not aim to replace EEBO, or to supplant conventional forms of research. Rather, our goal is to simply add a new item to the scholar’s toolbox, and to increase transferability between distant reading methodologies and more fine-grained forms of analysis. </p>

                <hi rend=""bold"">Negotiating the Complexities of Non-Standardized Spelling</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Standardized spelling had yet to emerge in early modernity: writers had the freedom to spell however they pleased. To take a famous example, the name ‘Shakespeare’ has 80 different recorded spellings, including ‘Shaxpere’ and ‘Shaxberd’. As one might imagine, variance on this scale presents a serious challenge for large-scale textual analysis. How is it possible to track the incidence of a specific word, or group of words, if any given word could have an unknown multiplicity of iterations? </p>
            <p>To address this problem, we enlisted the assistance of VARD 2, a tool that helps to improve the accuracy of textual analysis by finding candidate modern form replacements for spelling variants in historical texts.
                <hi rend=""superscript"">4</hi> As with conventional spellcheckers, a user can choose to process texts manually (selecting a candidate replacement offered by the system), automatically (allowing the system to use the best candidate replacement found), or semi-automatically (training the tool on a sample of the corpora). 
            </p>
            <p>After some preliminary training, we ran the TCP-EEBO corpus through VARD using the default settings (auto normalization at a threshold of 50%). Rather than using the ‘batch’ mode—which proved unreliable for such a big job—we wrote a script that normalized the texts on a one-by-one basis from the command-line. This process took about three days on a commodity machine. VARD normalized 80,676 terms for a grand total of 44,909,676 changes overall. </p>
            <p>A careful check through the list resulted in 373 term normalizations that we found problematic in one way or another. The problematic normalizations amounted to 462,975 changes overall, or only 1.03% of the total number of changes. These results were satisfactory: our goal was not to make the corpus ‘perfectly normalized’ (an impossibility, not least because perfection is debatable in this context), but, more pragmatically, to make it generally normalized, which is the best one can reasonably expect from an automatic process. On this point, it is important to note that VARD encodes a record of all changes within the output XML file, so scholars will be able to see if the program has made an erroneous normalization. </p>
            <p>Some of the problematic VARD normalizations seem to have derived from a dictionary error. For example, ‘chan’ became ‘champion’ and ‘ged’ became ‘general’. In other instances, the problematic normalizations were ambiguous or borderline cases that we preferred to simply leave unchanged. Examples include ‘piece’ for ‘peece’, and ‘land’ for ‘iland’. There were also cases where the replacement term was not quite correct: ‘strawberie’ became ‘strawy’ rather than ‘strawberry’, and ‘hoouering’ became ‘hoovering’ rather than ‘hovering’. We fixed as many of these kinks as we could by making adjustments to the VARD training file and running the entire corpus through the normalization process a second time. </p>
            <p>Of course, it is not difficult to imagine scenarios wherein a researcher may prefer to work with original spellings rather than normalized texts. With such projects in mind, we have kept both normalized and non-normalized versions of the EEBO-TCP corpus. </p>
            <p>
                <hi rend=""bold"">The DREaM Tutorial Program</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As noted above, one of the central objectives of DREaM is to create an interface that will maximize user-friendliness, allowing scholars with a minimal level of technical expertise to quickly and efficiently create subsets tailored for whatever specific research question they wish to pursue. We are building DREaM for our own research, but we also have a much broader pedagogical perspective in mind. To meet this objective, we have launched a pilot tutorial program, currently under way, that will teach scholars how to use DREaM, but will also point to ways in which DREaM could more effectively serve the demands of scholarly investigation. </p>
            <p>In a series of tasks that build toward the production of a short case-study report, pilot users must articulate a detailed research question and provide a description of their argument. In addition to establishing a valuable feedback loop for the project, this assignment aims to nudge new users toward a more comprehensive, more practical understanding of how macro-scale textual analysis can complement scholarly practice. The key conceptual challenge, as we see it, hinges on new users’ ability to understand, and learn to negotiate, the gap between distant reading and more conventional means of engaging archival sources. </p>
            <p>Our pool of pilot users derives from the membership of our parent project, Early Modern Conversions, a five-year interdisciplinary research initiative that has brought together a team of more than 100 scholars, partners, and graduate student associates from universities in Canada, the United States, England, New Zealand, and Australia.
                <hi rend=""superscript"">5</hi> Early Modern Conversions provides a propitious testing ground for DREaM because it is at the vanguard of early modern research, and because it entails a rich diversity of disciplinary approaches. Our presentation for DH2015 will report on the results of the tutorial program and on the progress of the project overall.

            <p>Figure 2. A sample subset transferred to Voyant Tools. Beginning in the top left corner, one sees a word cloud representing the frequency of keywords in terms of font size. At a glance, it shows that the highest frequency words in the subset are ‘good’ and ‘come’. Below the word cloud, there is a summary that lists statistics for basic categories such as word count, vocabulary density, word frequency, etc. In addition, the summary lists words that have a notably high frequency for each year: ‘Rome’ and ‘death’ appeared with particular frequency in 1594, while ‘virtue’ and ‘envy’ stood out in 1612. Moving to the bottom left corner, one sees an ordered list of frequencies for each word in the corpus accompanied by a thumbnail graph that tracks the frequency of words over the 40-year delimitation. At a glance, the tool shows a significant spike for the word ‘knight’ in 1624. In the middle of the screen, a ‘Corpus Reader’ tool enables users to drill down into the corpus to examine the context for particular terms. </p>

            <p>What does it mean to build visualization tools that support the research process in the humanities? In this paper we will trace the evolution of our thinking about data-driven tools beginning with case studies in early modern intellectual history and eventually including a wide range of projects from classics, social history, performance studies, and other fields. We will give concrete examples of how individual tools were designed and whether those tools ultimately failed or succeeded to provide scholars with a means to gain insights into historical data. Through these examples, this paper argues for the role of an open design process in the development of visualization tools for humanities research that brings designers, developers, and scholars into deep collaboration to build nuanced and rigorous tools for humanities research. </p>
            <p>Mapping the Republic of Letters</p>
            <p>Mapping the Republic of Letters was formed on the assumption that intellectual history is one of the fields that stands the most to gain from the influx of big data. By combining metadata from library catalogues and large-scale digitization projects, the project seeks to maximize the transformative effect of all this information. The cartographic, chronological, and network visualizations ultimately produced allow researchers to examine some of the big questions that intellectual historians have long struggled with: How do intellectual networks function? How interconnected are they? How independent are these networks from other social networks? </p>
            <p>The 2009 Digging Into Data Challenge grant award launched an active tool development phase in the Mapping the Republic of Letters (MRofL) project at Stanford. In partnership with DensityDesign Research Lab in Milan, the team began to engage in a tool design process in response to concrete research questions. The data—based on individuals and their correspondence, travel, and publications—were multidimensional and qualitatively rich. It became clear that historians who wish to bring data visualization tools to bear on the study of the past face a number of challenges. Many available tools had a steep learning curve and were ultimately of limited help for humanists. These tools rest on assumptions about the completeness and empirical value of data that often do not hold true for humanities research. Historical data can be incomplete and messy: statistical analysis can be a helpful to a limited extent, but interpretation at the most fundamental level is required to uncover meaning. Humanists also ask questions about the data that cannot be answered by numerical analysis. We needed tools that help us filter, contextualize, compare, and see the gaps in our data. </p>
            <p>Humanities + Design</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend=""color(262626)"">Humanities + Design, a research lab founded in 2012 by Dan Edelstein, Paula Findlen, and Nicole Coleman, emerged directly out of lessons learned and opportunities for humanities data analysis discovered through MRofL. The mission of the lab is to produce, through the lens of humanistic inquiry, new modes of thinking in design and computer science to serve data-driven research in the humanities. We believe that humanistic inquiry, grounded in interpretation, has much to contribute to the development of technologies if they are to help us reveal ambiguity and paradox, allowing human-scale exploration of complex systems. In the laboratory environment, theoretical and methodological discussions happen side by side with hands-on work with digital materials. Humanities scholars and students, designers, engineers, and computer scientists engage together in ongoing tool design as defined by the specific needs of participating humanities projects.</hi>

            <p>Palladio Project</p>
            <p>The award of the 2012 NEH Implementation Grant for Networks in History allowed the lab to pursue the development of visualization techniques and rich interaction with data that supports ‘thinking through data’ rather than using prescribed algorithms for data analysis. Palladio is a web-based demonstration application that allows any researcher to upload, visualize, and explore complex and multidimensional data, directly in a web browser. 
                <hi rend=""color(262626)"">It has been </hi>designed for humanistic inquiry, with a special focus on historical research. 
                <hi rend=""color(333333)"">The Palladio visualization system combines a primary view (for example, Map, Network Graph, and Tabular views) with filters to make it easy to query a dataset. </hi>

                <hi rend=""color(262626)"">Researchers can save and shared the work they have done in the browser as a Palladio Project. Palladio’s TimeLine and TimeSpan filters encourage filtering and sorting temporal data, and allows the filtering of two or more discontinuous time periods. A Facet filter is also particularly useful when exploring multidimensional datasets and drilling down to specific aspects of one’s data. Using case studies (examples listed later in this document) we will discuss how scholars have used Palladio, highlighting those instances when uses of the tool diverged from our expectations or led us toward new insights that we incorporated (or plan to incorporate) in future versions.</hi>

            <p>
                <hi rend=""color(444444)"">The development of Palladio has been an iterative process. We have been eliciting and incorporating feedback from the academic community concerning Palladio’s current and potential features and uses. Most specifically, we have engaged in sustained discussion with a small and inter-disciplinary group of scholars, known as Open Design Contributors. Our paper will offer insight into this design process and the ways that it has directly influenced current and future iterations of Palladio, as well as other tools.</hi>

            <p>Summary</p>
            <p>The core innovation of our project is the design of visualization techniques that emphasize the contextualization and interpretation of data in cases where we lack the metrics for useful quantitative analysis. The two other key innovations both involve the leveraging of novel technologies that are particularly important to the study of cultural heritage data: we use new flexible data models to let individual scholars create and apply their own data categorizations, and we use open linked data sources to reconcile datasets against established authority files, in order to link entities across datasets and thereby explore networks across collections.</p>

            <p>Dance scholar Kate Elswit has been using Palladio in her research on the labor of dance touring. She writes, ‘Such [visualization] techniques enable us to feel the passage of time differently.’ Following discussion with Elswit and other scholars interested in tracing travel routes, we have been thinking about how to display point-to-point travel in ways that go beyond simple flight-path-like visualizations. How to account for the differences in traveling at night rather than in the day? How to represent different levels of comfort, safety, and efficiency in travel?</p>
            <p>Case Study: Questions of Scale and Incomplete Data</p>

            <p>
                <hi rend=""color(222222)"">Taylor-Poleskey uses a large base of manuscript sources detailing the yearly consumption of one of the palaces of Prince-Elector Friedrich Wilhelm of Brandenburg-Prussia. She argues that the elector’s cultural agenda helped transform his territories over the course of his reign from dilapidated and war-torn to stable and powerful. To support her argument, she wants to see how tastes and consumption patterns changed over time, to consider how such changes might reveal the court’s aesthetic values and cultural ambitions. Creating visualizations in Palladio have helped her analyze what proportions of different foods or food groups were consumed. We have worked with Taylor-Poleskey toward creating visualizations that privilege the display of relative magnitude, and that are especially sensitive to working in different registers and scales. As some of the years in the sources she studies have incomplete or missing data, her use case has also aided us in thinking about how best to work with and represent incomplete data in ways that are not misleading or overly simplistic.</hi>

            <p>We will share results from our ongoing work with Thomas Faith at the Office of the Historian at the US Department of State, with whom we have been working toward the goal of producing an integrated version of Palladio that would function as a visual browser for extant online data concerning the foreign relations of the United States. The State Department project is one of many we are working on, as we look to help other researchers to implement customized versions of Palladio that can be used as search, analysis, and visualization exploratory tools within extant large-scale research projects.</p>

        <body>
            <p>Computational approaches to text analysis have revolutionised the ways in which scholarly research is being conducted. A number of tools exist that help scholars, from a variety of disciplines, analyse textual data, whether literary, historical, or otherwise, using scientific methodologies. However, many of these tools are either proprietary, present a steep learning curve, or are constructed without much transparency, often leaving users with results whose means of production they do not understand. This poster will outline the development of a tool that is intuitive and completely free and open-source, so that scholars in literary studies, and indeed the broader humanities, can leverage computational methods and big data analytics in their research.</p>
            <p>Nocht</p>
            <p>Nocht (trans.: to reveal, uncover), is developed, primarily, in Python, so that it is flexible, scalable, and cross-platform. It has been developed in accordance with the following principles:</p>
            <p> • It offers users a low-barrier means of using computational approaches to text analysis.</p>
            <p> • It is designed and developed in a humanities / arts / social sciences context.</p>
            <p> • It is completely open-source, removing the ‘black-box’, closed-code issues.</p>
            <p> • It brings together existing libraries and code-sets, acting as a ‘script portal’ of sorts.</p>
            <p>At present, Nocht supports the following methodologies, though with some limitations:</p>
            <p> • Wordcount and most frequent wordlists.</p>
            <p> • Word / wordlist frequency plotting.</p>
            <p> • Syntax and sentence analysis.</p>
            <p> • Sentiment analysis.</p>
            <p> • Topic modeling.</p>
            <p> • Zeta analysis.</p>
            <p>It is hoped that Nocht will further contribute to our field’s ongoing commitment to open and sustainable research tools, complementing highly regarded projects like Voyant
                <hi rend=""superscript"">1</hi> and Stylo (Eder et al., 2013). Its name is an obvious tribute to the former, which has for so long been one of our field’s fundamental tools. It is hoped that Nocht will add further to the DH toolkit, as well as complement the ongoing work of Voyant’s creators in leveraging the iPython architecture. 
            </p>
            <p>From a technical perspective, Nocht is scalable and robust, and satisfies the needs of a wide range of scholars, many of whom wish to conduct this form of research but lack the expertise or resources to do so. In this respect, it enables scholars, both emerging and established, to engage with cutting-edge analyses across a variety of disciplines. In many cases, it draws on a series of existing libraries and proven methodologies, such as NLTK
                <hi rend=""superscript"">2</hi> and matplotlib,
                <hi rend=""superscript"">3</hi> and so acts as a set of original scripts as well as a portal to existing tools. A complete technical overview of the project’s features, as well as the components utilised in its modular development, will be provided at the session. 
            </p>
            <p>Discussion</p>
            <p>This poster proposes to introduce Nocht to the field, discussing possible future development directions, as well as issues to date. Some of the disciplinary particularities identified by Gibbs and Owens (2012), such as our need to enhance the usability of our tools, will be addressed. The tension between having an intuitive interface and the need for scholarly tools to produce verifiable results is particularly clear in this project. While there is a long-established requirement that such tools be user-friendly (Krug 2005), one might argue that this must be balanced with a commitment to avoiding ‘black-box’ projects; usability does not necessarily equate to understanding. </p>
            <p>Measuring the value and success of development projects also remains problematic for scholars and practitioners working across the digital humanities. Schreibman and Hanlon’s survey (2010) finds that the majority of respondents were satisfied that their tools had been ‘successful’, enabling themselves and others to further their research. However, respondents also outlined that they had measured this success from a ‘controlled list’. As our methods continue to gain prominence beyond the core digital humanities community, we must find new metrics through which we can reliably measure the impact of our tools, not just in terms of user volumes, but in relation to the quality of research output. As a project that has sacrificed some aspects of usability and marketability in favour of broad functionality and a commitment to open principles, perhaps to its detriment, Nocht is an ideal catalyst for this debate. It is a small development with limited financial support, so it will be interesting to see if projects of this scale have a future in our discipline.</p>

            <p>Popular biographies of Queen Luise of Prussia (1776–1810, r. 1797–1810) written in the second half of the nineteenth century uniformly adhere to what Wulf Wülfing has called a ‘stations of the cross’ structure (Wülfing, 1984). Independent of whether the biography focuses on her domestic life, her personal character and temperament, or her influence at court, it relates and pays homage to canonical moments in Luise’s life story: her childhood encounter with Goethe’s mother, her presence at the coronation of the last Holy Roman Emperor, her meeting with her future husband, and several instances of informal, uncourtly conduct upon becoming princess. Biographies written for a variety of intended audiences (the German people, young Germans, young ladies, etc.) all adhere to the same narrative thread. While biographies on the same subject might be expected to follow a similar time line, popular treatments of Luise’s life and times tend to treat the same set of life anecdotes using the same language (Askey, 2013). While Luise’s function as a secular Prussian saint is one reason for the similarity of these biographies, another is their grounding in the same foundational texts. After Luise’s death in 1810, two biographies written by members of the Prussian court reached the public. King Friedrich Wilhelm III’s court pastor, Ruleman Friedrich Eylert, published 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Charakter-Züge und historische Fragmente aus dem Leben des Königs von Preussen Friedrich Wilhelm III </hi>(Characteristics and Historical Fragments form the Life of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia), a multivolume court history that contained over one volume of information on Queen Luise. And Luise’s lady in waiting, Countess Sophie Marie von Voss, published 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Neunundsechzig Jahre am preussischen Hofe; aus den Erinnerungen der Oberhofmeisterin Sophie Marie Gräfin von Voss </hi>(Sixty-Nine Years at the Prussian Court: The Memories of the Senior Lady in Waiting Countess Sophie Marie von Voss)
                <hi rend=""italic"">.</hi> This poster will introduce a digitization and textual analysis project that brings court and popular biographies into conversation with one another. 
            </p>
            <p> While the court biographies are available digitally, most of the popular biographies, especially those for children, are not. Libraries in the nineteenth century did not generally collect children’s literature, and so my personal collection of around a dozen Luise biographies for young readers will be digitized. Our team at the Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship will OCR the biographies, experimenting with ABBYY, OmniPage, and Tesseract to achieve optimal results with the notoriously difficult German 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Fraktur</hi> typescript. Once the corpus of official court and popular biographies has been created, we will perform standard text mining on the body of texts for young people to confirm or refute personal close readings. Our text mining queries will focus on the frequency of selected key terms relating to Luise’s life story, as well as the frequency of certain gendered textual markers (such as the word 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Gemüt</hi>—temperament, or words associated with clothing or fashion). The information gleaned from text mining will contribute to a scholarly discussion not only on the queen but on exemplarity, female childhood, and the gender discourse of the public sphere in the long nineteenth century. 
            </p>
            <p> The final step involves running subsets of the popular biographies (for the general public, for young people) and the court biographies through a comparison engine such as Juxta to determine adherence or deviation from a supposed ur-text. In the context of my previous work on Queen Luise and her literary function as exemplar for young German women, my hopes for the comparison step of the process are quite high. I use Voyant and Juxta to focus on specific language tokens that provide insight into gender norms and expectations, references to Luise’s physicality, and the development of nationalist discourse (apparent where the queen’s use of French at the court is set against her domestic use of German). </p>
            <p> The poster will illustrate the resource creation process (digitization and OCR of Fraktur texts, accessibility of that corpus for other scholars) as well as the first stages of textual analysis using the corpus. </p>

        <body>
            <p>In the first months of the HUMANIST discussion list a discussion erupted around the value of programming languages in humanities computing courses. Do computing humanists need to know how to program, or is learning expert use of applications enough? What is the point of learning to program? (McCarthy, 1987). This discussion can be traced back at least as far as the 1986 ACH/Sloan Workshop on Teaching ‘Computers and the Humanities’ Courses, where participants discussed ‘most vigorously of all whether programming should be taught, or only package programs’ (Sperberg-McQueen 1986). The issue has really never gone away as it is about disciplinary formation or ‘what it is we want our students to learn, the nature of the world into which we are sending them, and the relationship both of technology and (more fundamentally) the algorithmic approach to problem-solving’ (McCarty, 1987, 1–2). Based on a reading and analysis of a substantial collection of historical documents (journal articles, association newsletters, books, Listservs, etc.) in this paper we will examine how the humanities computing community discussed programming and how that discussion reflects changing views of the field over time. Specifically we will</p>
            <p> • Outline a three-part history of programming in the digital humanities starting with a concording phase when programming was not important to using computers.</p>
            <p> • Discuss the turn toward teaching programming as a way of teaching computational thinking.</p>
            <p> • Look at how the emergence of the Web changed the discussion. We will argue that as the Web became important, scripting skills suitable for building websites replaced older programming languages and it became possible to imagine the digital humanities being defined by the ability to program. </p>
            <p> • Conclude with some reflections on how the case for programming has been made more recently. </p>
            <p>
                <hi rend=""bold"">Humanities Computing as Concording</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I’ve tried to stay free of programming. I’m perfectly innocent of any knowledge of any programming language and I feel I must remain that way if I am going to continue to function as a scholar in literature; my heartfelt advice to any of you younger people embarking on this whole venture is to do the same—to ask programmers to do for you what they know how to do and what would be costly and painful for you to learn—to learn to talk their language but not to get involved in programming research or machine research. I know the best of you will not take this advice and will, therefore, break new barriers and so on, but I persist in offering it. (Parrish, 1969, 24–25) </p>
            <p>Programming in the early concording years of computing in the humanities was something often left to specialists. Stephen Parrish, who was general editor of the Cornell Concordance Series, saw himself as a ‘scholar in English literature who drifted laterally into the making of concordances’ (1969, 16). He stayed away from programming as a distraction from scholarship. This meant that concording ‘required an organized, teamwork approach, characterized by a substantial budget and a university computing centre’ (McCarty, 1993, 52–53). Parrish is not the only one to worry about programming distracting scholars, and in the presentation we will discuss other examples as a way of teasing out how programming was not considered of scholarly value. </p>
            <p>
                <hi rend=""bold"">Programming and Reasoning</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the 1980s, things had changed and programming had become important, as can be seen in the way programming was included in a majority of courses. Surveys like Joseph Rudman’s ‘Teaching Computers and the Humanities Courses: A Survey’ (1987) report 175 courses teaching a programming language while 131 were ‘Applications Only’. In that survey, the most popular languages taught were BASIC (in 75 courses reporting), Pascal (30 courses), Prolog (15 courses), Lisp (13 courses), and SNOBOL (10 courses). What is impressive is the number of responses that indicated they had some sort of course for humanities students. We often assume that computing in the humanities is a recent, post-advent-of-the-Web thing, but given the number of courses, the discussions on HUMANIST, and articles in journals like 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Computing and the Humanities</hi>, it is clear that programming was becoming an acceptable activity, especially for those in support staff positions. 
            </p>
            <p>Despite the popularity of programming languages like BASIC and Pascal for courses, the languages about which humanists wrote in the 1980s tended to be languages like SNOBOL and Icon—all languages that were good for string (text) manipulation, as can be seen in the attention they received in books for teaching programming to humanists like John Abercrombie’s 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Computer Programs for Literary Analysis</hi> (1984)
                <hi rend=""italic"">,</hi> Susan Hockey’s 
                <hi rend=""italic"">SNOBOL Programming for the Humanities</hi> (1985)
                <hi rend=""italic"">,</hi> and Alan Corré’s 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Icon Programming for Humanists</hi> (1990)
                <hi rend=""italic"">.</hi> Then there are the discussions on HUMANIST and reviews of languages like Mark Olsen’s self-explanatory ‘Beyond SNOBOL: The Icon Programming Language’. 
            </p>
            <p>As an aside, one could argue that SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) and later XML (Extensible Markup Language) are also forms of programming—meta-languages with which one can create descriptive languages with which to rigorously describe texts for scholarly electronic editions. These were popular in humanities computing, especially after the Text Encoding Initiative began to provide guidelines for the encoding of texts in the late 1980s. How many humanists were first introduced to computing in the humanities when asked to develop a DTD (Document Type Definition) and encode a text? </p>
            <p>It is interesting that many of the discussions about programming in the 1980s and early 1990s circle around the teaching of it and that this issue is reported as contentious. No one believed that the ability to program was essential for a computing humanist, in part because so many couldn’t, but proponents of programming argued for it to be taught as way of teaching computational reasoning or problem solving. They also argued that there were social and ethical issues that could be understood through learning computing. You learned to program so as to understand what the computer could do or to be able to talk to programmers. In the presentation we will look at summative discussions of the issue like McCarty’s (1987) and a lovely balanced essay by Nancy Ide, ‘Computers and the Humanities Courses: Philosophical Bases and Approach’ that came out of the 1986 ACH/Sloan Workshop. We will also speculate as to why there was this shift towards including programming and arguing for its importance. Whatever the reasons, the discourse had changed and computing humanists were beginning to take an interest in programming and teaching it. </p>
            <p>
                <hi rend=""bold"">Programming the Web </hi>
            </p>
            <p>The emergence of the Web changed the languages that humanists were likely to use for programming and, we will argue, made it possible to make programming a defining skill for digital humanists. Moreover, learning to program for the Web provided a more appealing and transferable skillset; web and application development became normalized and desirable. Because the Web provided such a convenient way to show and distribute digital research, it changed which programming languages received attention or were taught. We can see the shift in these histograms of word frequencies in the HUMANIST Archives. The string processing languages popular in the late 1980s taper off and are replaced with languages like PHP with which one can build dynamic websites. </p>

            <p>Now programming (and other web skills) went from being about teaching reasoning to being a skill students and humanists could actually use to create humanities products, i.e., websites. Programming became creative and expressive. There was also a convenient on-ramp as students could start creating HTML pages and then learn to use scripting languages like PHP that enhanced the web site until you knew enough to code a scholarly web site. </p>
            <p>We will further argue that once web development wasn’t something that digital humanists would necessarily be amateurs at, then it could become a defining skill, and a source of some pride. Digital humanists finally had something that they could be good at and a set of competencies unique to the digital humanities. Digital humanists like Stephen Ramsay could provocatively say, ‘Do you have to know how to code? I’m a tenured professor of Digital Humanities and I say “yes”’ (Ramsay 2011). This led to the ‘hack vs. yack’ discussion that followed about programming and other forms of building (see Nowviskie [2014] for more general context). </p>
            <p>
                <hi rend=""bold"">Conclusions: Programming in the Humanities and Disciplinary Formation </hi>
            </p>
            <p>This paper traces the ways programming has been discussed in the digital humanities. We believe that the role of programming was important to the way the field of humanities computing (and later digital humanities) conceived of itself. This is not surprising given the importance of programming to computing in general, but it is interesting to follow the particular ways programming was discussed as the discipline emerged. </p>
            <p>We will end the paper by theorizing, or at least speculating, about where programming in digital humanities is going. One direction (already well under way) is towards software studies and the studying of programmed artifacts as works of human art and expression worthy of the humanities. Matthew Kirschenbaum in a fine essay for the 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Chronicle of Higher Education</hi> talks about ‘procedural literacy’. 
            </p>
            <p>All programming entails world-making, as the ritual act of writing and running Hello World reminds us. . . . </p>
            <p> Ultimately what’s at stake is not the kind of vocational computer literacy I was taught as an undergraduate, but what a growing number of practitioners in the digital humanities (and related disciplines, like digital art or game studies) have begun to call procedural rhetoric, or procedural literacy. (Kirschenbaum, 2009) </p>
            <p>Another direction is data science. The opportunities for new insights through large-scale text mining, or what Moretti (2007) calls distant reading, have made programming languages like R attractive. There is a return to text processing languages, but now languages that can analyze large corpora or visualize results.</p>

            <p>The process of tokenizing texts is typically out of sight and almost out of mind—often handled invisibly by the analyst’s program or R script, and rarely described, discussed, or even mentioned. For ‘big data’, even if questions did arise about the nature of the word list produced, testing is not feasible. Furthermore, tokenizer accuracy is so critically affected by the state and nature of the texts that probably no general measure of accuracy or appropriateness is possible. Finally, built-in programming functions and libraries are all too often used uncritically with little realization that their output does not conform to the assumptions or expectations of the analyst. I suggest that we should pay a little more attention to the theory and practice of tokenization.
                <hi rend=""superscript"">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider a hypothetical case. Let’s say I want to analyze 5,000 novels, have access to the texts at HathiTrust, download 5,000 novels in plain text, and tokenize them. Below is part of a page from Elizabeth Gaskell’s 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Cranford</hi>, from HathiTrust (Gaskell, 1910 [1851], 107):
            </p>
            <figure>
                <graphic n=""1001"" width=""9.710208333333334cm"" height=""10.4775cm"" url=""Pictures/image1.png"" rend=""block""/>
            </figure>
            <p>Figure 1. 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Cranford</hi>, Elizabeth Gaskell, from page 107.
            </p>
            <p>A human reader would have little trouble tokenizing this passage, and it is not extremely problematic, though minor OCR problems exist (mainly spacing issues around single quotation marks / apostrophes and dashes, and the line-end hyphen). I tokenized this passage with The Intelligent Archive (2012), KWIC (Tsukamoto, 2004) WordSmith Tools (Scott, 2012), Voyant (Sinclair et al., 2012), and Stylo (Eder et al., 2014).
                <hi rend=""superscript"">2</hi> Even on this short text, the five programs identify three different numbers of types and two different numbers of tokens, largely because of the handling of single quotation marks. KWIC and WordSmith produce identical lists, as do Voyant and Stylo, but neither of these match The Intelligent Archive.
            </p>
            <p>Now consider Charles Chesnutt’s 
                <hi rend=""italic"">The House Behind the Cedars</hi> (1900, 13), also from HathiTrust:
            </p>
            <figure>
                <graphic n=""1002"" width=""8.89cm"" height=""8.810625cm"" url=""Pictures/image2.png"" rend=""block""/>
            </figure>
            <p>Figure 2. 
                <hi rend=""italic"">The House Behind the Cedars</hi>, Charles Chesnutt, from page 13.
            </p>
            <p>The dialect in this passage is challenging even for human readers, and the OCR is more problematic. For example, the printed text (judging from the PDF) had spaced contractions, which explains ‘you 're’ in the fourth line from the bottom and the space in ‘lie 's’ in the first line, where the text reads “he 's.” This classic OCR problem occurs several times in this novel. And in the last line ‘you '11’ has both a space and an erroneous number 11 for the ‘ll’ (double el), another common OCR problem. Those analyzing big data usually rely on the insignificance of random error, but these and many other kinds of error are not random, and systematic error within one text, one author, one genre, or one collection could easily lead to thousands of inaccurate word frequency counts in this hypothetical study of 5,000 texts.</p>
            <p>The use of apostrophes in the Chesnutt passage to indicate dialect pronunciations can also severely affect tokenization. Although The Intelligent Archive, KWIC, and WordSmith Tools produce exactly the same lists for this brief passage, and Voyant has the same number of types and tokens, Voyant removes all initial (but not final) apostrophes, creating different words for eight of the 97 types. Stylo removes all numbers, all initial and final apostrophes, and many internal apostrophes, retaining them only in 
                <hi rend=""italic"">ain^t, gentleman^s</hi>, and 
                <hi rend=""italic"">spen^s</hi> (replaced with a caret). It produces six more tokens and four more types than the other programs, and many more differences in the word list. Unfortunately, in Chesnutt’s short novel, more than 650 words begin and/or end with apostrophes crucial to the identity of the word, so that the word lists produced by Voyant and Stylo are quite inaccurate. Furthermore, only KWIC and WordSmith Tools let the user choose whether apostrophes and hyphens are part of a word, and whether numbers can appear in the word list or not. Only WordSmith Tools allows the user to choose whether to allow apostrophes at the beginnings and/or ends of the word as well as internally.
            </p>
            <p>Obviously, the two texts examined above cause different problems, and different tokenizers are more accurate for one than for the other. Worse yet, these problems are found even in relatively carefully edited texts like those from Project Gutenberg. Although Gutenberg’s 
                <hi rend=""italic"">The House Behind the Cedars</hi> does not have spaced contractions, and correctly has 
                <hi rend=""italic"">he’s</hi> in the first line and 
                <hi rend=""italic"">you’ll</hi> in the final line, the 29 initial and final dialect apostrophes remain problematic. The Gutenberg text also represents dashes as two hyphens without spaces, creating more problems for tokenizers. The Intelligent Archive and Stylo treat these double-hyphen dashes as breaking characters, while retaining single hyphens within compound words, but KWIC, WordSmith Tools, and Voyant treat them like single hyphens, creating compounds with double hyphens where dashes are needed. The situation is still more complex if a double-hyphen is preceded or followed by a breaking character. If this sounds esoteric, consider that this short novel contains nearly 400 double-hyphen dashes (Dickens’ 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Dombey and Son</hi> has more than 2,200). And this problem, too, is highly systematic: words vary considerably in how frequently they are preceded or followed by a dash, and 1,000 dash errors per text would produce 5,000,000 errors in our hypothetical 5,000 novels. (For a practical example of the effects of error, see Matt Jockers’ discussion of topic modeling and several ‘topics’ that arose from OCR error and metadata (Jockers, 2013, 135).
            </p>
            <p>It might seem that we just need more sophisticated tokenizers, but the required level of sophistication to handle double-hyphen dashes correctly is quite high, and the problems caused by apostrophes and single quotation marks cannot be correctly solved computationally at all. In some cases, not even a human reader can tokenize with certainty; in others, a computer can solve problems a human cannot. </p>
            <p>Let’s consider a few further tokenization questions:</p>
            <p>He said, “That’s ’bout ‘nough, sho’.”</p>
            <p>“That’s ‘bout’, not ‘fight’; ’nough said,” Nough said.</p>
            <p>“John tried that ‘Nough told me to’ on me,” Bill whined.</p>
            <p>He remarked, “John said, ‘Bout starts at nine.’”</p>
            <p>He remarked, “John said, ‘It’s ’bout time.’”</p>
            <p>He remarked, “John said, ‘‘Bout time.’” Can these apostrophes/single quotes be handled correctly computationally? How about the two single quotes before ‘Bout’ in the last example?</p>
            <p>I visited the U.S.S.R. Four tokens? Seven? Is the final period part of the final token?</p>
            <p>I visited the U.S.S.R.! Four tokens? Seven? Is the final period part of the final token?</p>
            <p>Is that C------? Is ‘C------’ the token ‘C’ followed by a dash, or the token ‘C------’? What about ‘C—’? Or ‘C-’?</p>
            <p>C------ is here. Same questions.</p>
            <p>Oh d--n it! Is ‘d--n’ the tokens ‘d’ and ‘n’ separated by a dash, or the token ‘d--n’? How about ‘d---n’? or ‘d-n’? or ‘G-d’?</p>
            <p>I said--never mind. If ‘d--n’ is a token, can we prevent ‘said--never’ from being a token here?</p>
            <p>That’s what I--a mistake, sorry. How do we get ‘d--n’ correct without failing here?</p>
            <p>You’re a real %#@$! Three tokens? Four? Does the last include the final ‘!’? What if there were a period after the ‘!’?</p>
            <p>You’re a real %#@$!. How about now?</p>
            <p>I am working on a Python tokenizer that can handle most of these issues correctly, and some of these problems are fairly rare, but I despair of the possibility of creating a word frequency list that is ‘correct’ even in my own opinion. For many years I have ‘corrected’ the texts before tokenizing, but that is not a practical solution for 5,000 novels and presents its own problems.</p>
            <p>Perhaps in sufficiently big data, the error introduced by tokenizers will not significantly alter the results, and Maciej Eder (2013) has recently shown that some corpora are remarkably resistant to some kinds of intentionally introduced error. And improving the quality of the corpus had a relatively small effect on the attribution of the Federalist Papers (Levitan and Argamon, 2006). More study seems needed before we can be complacent, however, even in large-scale problems involving only authorship or classification. For smaller-scale stylistic studies, tokenization decisions can clearly have serious repercussions. Consider Ramsay’s (2011) analysis of 
                <hi rend=""italic"">The Waves</hi>, where decisions about tokenization significantly alter the lists of men-only and women-only words and words that characterize the six narrative voices (see Hoover [2014a] and Plasek and Hoover [2014], for discussion). Another example that replicates an experience I have had several times is that a Full Spectrum analysis (Hoover, 2014b), based on Craig’s version of Burrows’s Zeta (Burrows, 2007; Craig and Kinney, 2010) can give strange results if uncorrected texts are inadvertently included. For example, in a test of Charlotte Brontë versus Anne and Emily Brontë, 11 of the 100 most distinctive words were words with inappropriate initial “apostrophes” because the novels of Anne and Emily in the analysis both used single quotation marks for dialogue.
            </p>
            <p>Far from being an insignificant tool that can be taken for granted, a tokenizer expresses its author’s theory of text and can significantly affect the results of many kinds of text analysis.</p>
            <p>Notes</p>
            <p rend=""footnote text"">1. As a reviewer of this paper has pointed out, the problems of tokenization have been more widely recognized recently in the NLP community. For example, Dridan and Oepen (2012) and Chiarcos et al. (2012) address and suggest partial solutions for some of the problems discussed here. Even if the problems had all been solved within the NLP community (a fact not in evidence), however, this would not diminish the force of my argument for the DH community, where there has been much less attention paid to them.</p>
            <p rend=""footnote text"">2. These programs represent a variety of those used in DH work (in order): a mature Java program with a database function, a venerable corpus linguistics program with lots of functions and user-options, a highly customizable and powerful commercial program from OUP, a widely used online tool, and a recently developed set of tools written in the currently popular R.</p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>Big Data is reshaping the historical profession in ways we are only now beginning to grasp. The growth of digital sources since the advent of the World Wide Web in 1990-91 presents new opportunities for social and cultural historians. Large web archives contain billions of webpages, from personal homepages to professional or academic websites, and now make it possible for us to develop large-scale reconstructions of the recent web. Yet the sheer number of these sources presents significant challenges: if the norm until the digital era was to have human information vanish, “now expectations have inverted. Everything may be recorded and preserved, at least potentially” (Gleick, 2012).</p>
                <p>While the Internet Archive makes archived web content available to the general public and mainstream scholarly community through its “Wayback Machine,” (at <ref target=""http://archive.org/web"">http://archive.org/web</ref>) which allows visitors to enter a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to visit archived web versions of a particular page, this system is limited: not only do visitors need to know the URL in the first place, but they are limited to individual readings of single webpages.</p>
                <p>By unlocking the Wayback Machine’s underlying system of specialized files, primarily ISO-standardized WebARChive (WARC) files, we can develop new ways to systematically track, visualize, and analyze change occurring over time within web archives. Warcbase, an open-source platform for managing web archives built on Hadoop and HBase, provides a flexible data model for storing and managing raw content as well as metadata and extracted knowledge. Tight integration with Hadoop provides powerful tools for analytics and data processing. Using a case study of one collection, this paper introduces the work that we have been doing to facilitate web archive access with warcbase. We have growing documentation at <ref target=""http://docs.warcbase.org"">http://docs.warcbase.org</ref>.</p>

                <head>Project Rationale and Case Study</head>
                <p>In 1996, the Internet Archive launched a complementary research services company, Archive-It, which offers subscription-based web archiving to collecting institutions. </p>
                <p>The University of Toronto Library (UTL) began collecting a quarterly crawl in 2005 of Canadian political parties and political interest groups (the collections were separate in 2005, merging in 2006) (University of Toronto, 2015). The collection itself has a murky history: UTL had been part of a broader project that would have collected political websites. It fell through, but UTL opted to carry out their crawl on their own and the librarian was responsible for selecting the seed list herself (faculty and other librarians did not respond for calls for engagement). While formal political parties are robustly covered, the “political interest groups” collection was a bit more nebulous: sites were discovered through keyword searches, and some were excluded due to robots.txt exclusion requests. Beyond this brief sketch, we have little information about the decisions made in 2005 to create this collection. This lack of documentation is a shortcoming of this collection model, as if a historian was to use this material in a peer-reviewed paper, questions would be raised about its representativeness.</p>
                <p>If a user wants to use the Canadian Political Parties and Interest Groups Collection (CPP) through Archive-It today, they visit the collection page at https://archive-it.org/collections/227 and enter full-text search queries. In August 2015, our group also launched <ref target=""http://webarchives.ca"">http://webarchives.ca</ref>, based on the British Library’s SHINE front end for web archives; this was a way to facilitate a different form of more casual user access, aimed at the general public (we discuss this in a separate paper).</p>
                <p>The Archive-It portal is limited. There are no readily-available metrics of how many pages have been collected, how they break down by domain and date, and the portal undoubtedly provides skewed results unless the search phrase is dramatically narrowed down.</p>
                <p>Consider the search for “Stephen Harper,” Canada’s Prime Minister between 2006 and 2015 in Figure 1.</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>The results are decent: Harper’s Facebook page from 2009, a Twitter snapshot from 2010, and some long-form journalism articles and opposition press releases. But amidst the 1,178,351 results, there is no indication as to how the ranking took place, what facets are available, and how things may have changed over the last ten years of the crawl.</p>
                <p>The data is there, but the problem is access.</p>

                <head>Warcbase: A Platform for Web Archive Analysis</head>
                <p>Warcbase is a web archive platform, not a single program. Its capabilities comprise two main categories:</p>
                <list type=""ordered"">
                    <item>Analysis of web archives using the Pig or Spark programming languages, and assorted helper scripts and utilities</item>
                    <item>Web archive database management, with support for the HBase distributed data store, and OpenWayback integration providing a friendly web interface to view stored websites</item>
                </list>
                <p>One can take advantage of the analysis tools (1) without bothering with the database management aspect of Warcbase – in fact, most digital humanities researchers will probably find the former more useful. This paper focuses on the former capabilities, showing how we can use the warcbase platform to carry out text and network analyses.</p>
            </div>
            <div type=""div1"" rend=""DH-Heading1"">
                <head>Using Warcbase on Web Archival Collections: Text Analysis</head>
                <p>We have begun to document all warcbase commands on a GitHub wiki, found at 
                    <ref target=""https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki"">https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki</ref>. We begin with installation instructions, and then provide simple scripts written in Apache Spark to run the commands.</p>
                <p>While possible to generate a plain text version of the entire collection, a more fruitful approach has been to generate date-ordered text for particular domains. If a researcher is interested in say, the Green Party of Canada’s evolution between 2005 and 2015, they can extract the plain text for greenparty.ca by running the following script:</p>
                <figure>
                    <graphic url=""99/image2.png"" rend=""inline""/>
                </figure>
                <p>All they would need to change would be the path/to/input to the directory with their web archive files, the path/to/output for where they want to save the resulting plain-text files, and the greenparty.ca value to whatever domain they might be interested in researching.</p>
                <p>They then receive a date-ordered output of all plain text for that domain (as per the extractCrawldateDomainUrlBody command). It can then be sorted and used in other research avenues. For example, this plain text could be loaded into a text analysis suite such as <ref target=""http://voyant-tools.org/"">http://voyant-tools.org/</ref> or other digital humanities environments.</p>
                <p>We have also been experimenting with other visualizations based on the extracted plain text. Computationally intensive textual analysis can be carried out using warcbase itself. Using the Stanford NER package in parallel, we have a script that extracts entities, counts them, and then visualizes them using D3.js to help see overall changes in a web archival collection. Figure 2 below shows the output of the NER visualizer.</p>
                <figure>

                    <head>Figure 2: Named Entity Visualization within Warcbase</head>
                </figure>
                <p>Finally, another text approach is topic modelling (Blei et al., 2003). LDA works by finding topics in unstructured text. To visualize topic models, we elected to use the Termite Data Server, which is a visual analysis tool for exploring the output of statistical topic models (“uwdata/termite-data-server,” n.d.). As Figure 3 demonstrates, the visualization allows you to get a top-down view at the topics found in a web archive.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Warcbase presents versatile opportunities to extract plain text and move it into other environments for analysis. Unlike the keyword-based Archive-It portal, we now have data that can be inquired in many fruitful ways.</p>

                <head>Using Warcbase on Web Archival Collections: Hyperlink Analysis</head>
                <p>Warcbase can also extract hyperlinks. While text can be very important, these sorts of metadata can often be more important: allowing us to see changes in how groups link to each other, what articles and issues were important, and how relationships changed over time.</p>
                <p>Consider Figure 4, which visualizes the links stemming from and between the websites of Canada’s three main political parties.</p>
                <figure>

                    <head>Figure 4: Three major political parties in Canada</head>
                </figure>
                <p>Above, we can see which pages only link to the left-leaning New Democratic Party (ndp.ca), those that link only to the centrist Liberals (liberal.ca) in the top, and those that only connect to and from the right-wing Conservative Party at right. We can use it to find further information, such as in Figure 5.</p>
                <figure>
                    <graphic url=""99/image6.png"" rend=""inline""/>
                    <head>Figure 5: NDP attack</head>
                </figure>
                <p>The above links are from the 2006 Canadian federal election. The Liberal Party was then in power and was under attack by both the opposition parties. In particular, the left-leaning NDP linked hundreds of times to their ideologically close cousins, the centrist Liberals, as part of their electoral attacks, ignoring the right-leaning Conservative Party in the process. Link metadata illuminates more than a close reading of an individual website would. It contextualizes and tells stories itself.</p>
                <p>While we have traditionally used Gephi to do analysis, importing material into Gephi from warcbase required many manual steps as documented at <ref target=""https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Gephi:-Converting-Site-Link-Structure-into-Dynamic-Visualization"">https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Gephi:-Converting-Site-Link-Structure-into-Dynamic-Visualization</ref>. We have been prototyping a link analysis visualization in D3.js, which can run in browser (Figure 6).</p>

                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p>With the increasingly widespread availability of large web archives, historians and Internet scholars are now in a position to find new ways to track, explore, and visualize changes that have taken place within the first two decades of the Web. Warcbase will allow them to do so. This project is among the first attempts to harness data in ways that will enable present and future historians to usefully access, interpret, and curate the masses of born-digital primary sources that document our recent past.</p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>The development of applications in the field of Digital Humanities (DH) does not adequately take into account domain modelling, software design principles and software engineering methodologies (Bozzi, 2013; D'Iorio, 2015; McCarty, 2008; Terras and Crane, 2010). In fact, many systems developed in the context of DH-related projects have not been conceived to be modular, extensible, and scalable: they only tend to solve specific problems such as data-driven and project-oriented tools (Boschetti and Del Grosso, 2015). In addition, most projects focus on the requirements of humanists (as end users), but leave out the needs of software developers.</p>
                <p>This research was motivated by a number of issues emerged from the projects we worked on 
                    <hi rend=""background-color(#ffff00)""> </hi>(Abrate et al., 2014a; Albanesi et al., 2015; Bellandi et al., 2014; Bozzi, 2015; Del Grosso, 2013; Ruimy et al., 2012) and it fits into an ongoing discussion about textual modelling and research infrastructures (Moulin et al., 2011; Pierazzo, 2015; Schmidt, 2014). In particular, this work aims at providing methodological guidelines for the definition of the core entities of a digital scholarly environment. We chose to adopt an object-oriented approach since it can bring benefits in the definition of efficient and effective digital tools (Boschetti et al., 2014; Del Grosso and Nahli, 2014). To give an analogy, the environment we propose can help developers and scholars as CMS (e.g. Wordpress) can help Web designers and publishers.
                </p>
                <p>The development of the environment follows three criteria: i) adopting an agile process (Ashmore and Runyan, 2014) to define the nature and behavior of the environment through both functional (e.g. user stories) and non-functional requirements (e.g. data model, system architecture) (Cohn, 2004; Collins-Cope et al., 2005); ii) providing well-defined Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) among components (Grill et al., 2012; Tulach, 2008); iii) applying analysis, architectural and design patterns for the sake of abstraction, generalization and flexibility (Ackerman and Gonzalez, 2011; Buschmann et al., 2007; Gamma et al., 1995).</p>
                <p>Following the agile methodology, we are developing a modular environment by starting from the design and implementation of a 
                    <hi rend=""bold"">microkernel</hi> (Buschmann et al., 1996) as the manager of the different components. In addition, the microkernel provides all the operations needed to manipulate the domain basic entities which are described in the section “Domain entities and design patterns”.
                </p>
                <div type=""div2"" rend=""DH-Heading2"">
                    <head>Related works</head>
                    <p>Digital humanists have access to several tools for literary studies. TextGrid, for example, provides integrated tools for analyzing texts and gives computer support for digital editing purposes (Hedges et al., 2013). The NINES project offers an environment to support scholars in the creation of long-term digital research materials. It includes three main tools: Collex (Nowviskie, 2007), Juxta, and Ivanhoe. Annotation Studio is a collaborative system to annotate texts and add links to multimedia objects (Paradis et al., 2013). The CULTURA project aims at developing a “corpus agnostic research environment” providing customizable services for a wide range of users (Steiner et al., 2014). The development of an online workspace which helps scholars in the production of critical editions is the main objective of the Workspace for Collaborative Editing framework (Houghton et al., 2014). It uses existing standards and open-source solutions to create an architecture of reusable components. Other platforms worth mentioning are TUSTEP/TXSTEP (Ott, 2000; Ott and Ott, 2014), WebLicht (Hinrichs et al., 2010), Perseids (Almas and Beaulieu, 2013), Muruca/Pundit (Grassi et al., 2013), Textual Communities (Bordalejo and Robinson, 2015), SAWS (Jordanous et al., 2012), Voyant Tools (Sinclair and Rockwell, 2012), Transcribe Bentham (Causer and Terras, 2014) and Alcide (Moretti et al., 2014). However, the aforementioned initiatives allow digital scholars to meet specific needs, but none of them seems to provide, simultaneously, all the following characteristics: i) reusability and extensibility, ii) ease of use and configuration, iii) continuous availability of the services and development over time, iv) a well-grounded software data model.</p>

                <head>Domain entities and design patterns</head>
                <p>One of the main challenges of the DH community is to provide suitable software models and tools (Ciotti, 2014). To model the literary domain and the relative user requirements, we chose to follow the engineering principles of 
                    <hi rend=""bold"">object-oriented analysis and design</hi> (Ackerman and Gonzalez, 2011). The digital representation of a textual resource is a challenge as it involves several theoretical and epistemological issues in semiotics, paleography, philology, linguistics, engineering, and computer science (McCarty, 2005; Meister, 2012; Moretti, 2013; Robinson, 2013; Sahle, 2013).
                </p>
                <p>In this work, we define each textual element by means of four properties: i) the 
                    <hi rend=""bold"">version</hi> allows to select a specific textual element among those available in its history of changes; ii) the 
                    <hi rend=""bold"">granularity</hi> represents a level of a hierarchical structure (e.g. a page composed of lines); iii) the 
                    <hi rend=""bold"">position</hi> provides the location of a textual element within the hierarchical representation (e.g. the second page of a book); iv) the 
                    <hi rend=""bold"">layer</hi> indicates the set of homogeneous information the textual element belongs to (e.g. morphological layer). As pointed outby (Buzzetti, 2002; McGann, 2004; Pierazzo, 2015), the information conveyed by a textual resource is logically organized through multiple layers (also called 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">dimensions</hi>) of information.

                    </figure>On these four properties we have designed and implemented a set of core entities as the fundamental data types shared among all the components of the environment (Fig. 1)
                    <note xml:id=""ftn1"" place=""foot"" n=""1""> The ongoing implementation of the environment is available at: https://github.com/literarycomputinglab</note>. The 
                    <hi rend=""bold"">Source</hi> class is in charge of managing the low-level data: it is composed of a 
                    <hi rend=""bold"">Payload</hi> representing the information conveyed by the textual resource and a
                    <hi rend=""bold"">SourceType</hi> which indicates the nature of the Source (e.g. text, image, audio, etc.). Payload objects (as used in networking) have the only purpose of encapsulating the information. The 
                    <hi rend=""bold"">Locus</hi> and the 
                    <hi rend=""bold"">P</hi>
                    <hi rend=""bold"">lace</hi>
                    <hi rend=""bold"">OfInterest</hi> (POI) classes identify, through a 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">composition pattern</hi>, specific data fragments of the source content, and they are used to establish the boundaries of an 
                    <hi rend=""bold"">Annotation</hi>. A chunk of text, for example, can be addressed to by a locus having a POI (of type Sequence of Interest) representing its start and end coordinates. Similarly, a region of an image can be identified by a locus having a POI (of type Region of Interest) composed of a sequence of coordinates. The Locus and POI provide a stand-off text annotation technique able to tackle, for example, the overlapping hierarchies problem, which cannot be handled easily with inline markup techniques (Schmidt, 2010). As a matter of fact, it is possible, simultaneously, to manipulate a resource on the basis of its documental and textual structure (Renear et al., 1996; Robinson, 2013) (see the example in the following section). However, since stand-off models are affected by the issue of the indexing updating, a dedicated component must be in charge of automatically maintaining the coherence of the annotations each time the underlying text is edited.
                </p>
                <p>An Annotation represents an information associated to a locus and is defined by an 
                    <hi rend=""bold"">AnnotationType</hi> (e.g. a token, a lemma, a named entity, etc.). Since the hierarchical structure of the source may evolve over time, the changes to the relative tree must be managed. For example, a tree structure having tokens as leaves could need to be updated with a finer-grained layer of characters (e.g. to assign annotations to specific letters). In this case, the tokens should become intermediate nodes and the characters would become the leaf nodes. Typically, this kind of editing is unpredictable and it often implies heavy adaptations if the software is not flexible enough to manage changes in the underlying text representation schema. Consequently, we decided to exploit the flexibility of the Object Oriented model by adopting the Role Design Pattern (Fowler, 1997) to switch between leaf and intermediate nodes dynamically. This pattern has been implemented by the

                <head>An Example</head>
                <p>We here introduce an example showing a representation of a snippet of text with annotations. The chosen text is an excerpt of a letter, written in Latin, belonging to the epistolary corpus of the Clavius on the Web project
                    <note xml:id=""ftn2"" place=""foot"" n=""2""> Clavius on the Web is a project funded by Registro.it and partecipated by the Institute of Informatics and Telematics (IIT-CNR), the Institute of Computational Linguistics “A. Zampolli” (ILC-CNR), and the Historical Archives of the Pontifical Gregorian University (APUG). Website: http://claviusontheweb.it/</note> (Abrate et al., 2014b). Fig. 2 shows a typical way of encoding sentences and lines with a markup language as TEI (Burnard, 2014): the resulting XML hierarchical structure has been broken by the addition of the line anchors (<lb />) mixing up the textual and documental structure of the text. Indeed, to preserve the integrity of the word “Dinostrati” (spanning across lines 4 and 5), it is necessary to encapsulate it with the element <w />.

                    </figure>The model we propose solves this problem with the stand-off annotations: as shown in Fig. 3 the document (made of lines) and the textual structure (made of sentences and words) are logically separated. Lines, sentences and words do not overlap and they are structured in separate hierarchies.

                <head>Motivation</head>
                <p>In last years, the advancements in computer science brought a global change in the way information is stored, retrieved and analyzed. The digital humanities also benefit from these developments, and now, a vast amount of texts is available in digital form. This information explosion generates interesting research questions for humanities scholars who are capable of deriving new insights from this knowledge bank. In order to support humanities scholars, many visualization techniques – summarized in a survey (Jänicke et al., 2015b) – were developed to aid exploring large texts collections. Most of these techniques are interactive and belong to the category of distant reading (Moretti, 2005). The authors of the mentioned survey observe that less work has been done to improve the close reading capabilities of humanities scholars even though they are often focused on close reading text passages.</p>
                <p>Close reading is the careful interpretation of the text, where the scholar iteratively reads the text in order to explore its meaning, inherent topics and occurring relationships (Boyles, 2013). Traditionally, close reading is done on paper. Several ideas and thoughts are made persistent by annotations written at the margins alongside the text (see Figure 1). But as the margin space is limited, not all observations can be put around the text. So, annotations may become cluttered and confusing for the reader, especially, when obsolete ideas are struck through. Despite its disadvantages, annotating on paper is still quite popular as it benefits the scholars to record observations about the hypothesis and all these changes reappear in front of the scholar’s eyes as soon as he re-reads the text passage. We observed that the way of annotating in close reading resembles the idea of mind maps (Buzan et al., 1993) that are based on a central concept and thoughts are represented around it using lines and text. In the close reading scenario, the text can be considered as the central concept and annotations represent thoughts.</p>
                <p>An important task of computer science is to enhance the original workflows of researchers with computational methods. As most humanities scholars are well trained in close reading and nowadays often work with digital texts, it is necessary to enhance their capabilities for digital close reading. We propose an enhanced close reading design inspired by mind-maps that not only mimics the traditional way of annotating a text on paper, but also helps humanities scholars to perform live visual analyses. Furthermore, we use extendible margins to provide enough space for all thoughts of the scholar.</p>

                <p>Nancy Boyles (Boyles, 2013) defines close reading, which has become a fundamental method in literary criticism in the 20th century (Hawthorn, 2000), as follows: “Essentially, close reading means reading to uncover layers of meaning that lead to deep comprehension.” Annotating the text in close reading is a strong method for scholars to facilitate the understanding of a text passage. Figure 1 shows the result of a traditional close reading approach. In this example, various annotation methods were used by the scholar to annotate various features of a text passage in Charles Dickens' „David Copperfield“. </p>
                <p>The availability of digital texts has further awaken the interest of humanities scholars in collaboratively close reading the same texts. There are several annotation tools for such a purpose, such as eMargin (Kehoe et al., 2013), Hypothes.is (Bonn et al., 2014) and NB (Zyto et al., 2012). These tools are beneficial for collaborative research and classroom environments as they provide an excellent paradigm to share thoughts, as well as find collective answers. To avoid clutter, these tools work with popup windows that are only shown on demand. In Figure 2, the eMargin system is shown where colors are used to highlight different text features, and a popup window on demand, lists the comments of collaborating scholars.</p>

                <p>Digital Ink Annotations systems (Schilit, 1998, Bargeron et al., 2003, Agrawala et al., 2005, Yoon et al., 2013) also support annotating text, but their use is only limited to pen-based computing devices such as tablets. The systems are designed to work well on smaller screens, and the adaption to larger screens is not appropriately implemented. </p>
                <p>Close reading tasks can also be assisted via distant reading tools. For example, parallel coordinates, a heatmap and a dot plot are used to analyze the variance of a selected text passage from different German translations of Shakespeare’s Othello (Geng et al., 2013). Heat maps are appropriate visualizations to illustrate the distribution of specific phrases or annotations in a corpus (Muralidharan, 2011, Alex et al., 2015). Voyant Tools allow the user to perform basic text mining functions with selected word statistics shown in linked views (Sinclair et al., 2012). The Voyant Tools interface in Figure 3 shows statistics about Chapter 2 of Oscar Wilde's “David Copperfield”. Goffin's idea to enhance close reading is the integration of small visualizations (e.g., maps or bar charts) besides the words of a text (Goffin et al., 2014).</p>

                <head>Enhanced Close Reading Design</head>
                <p>In contrast to the tools mentioned above, we combine traditional annotation tasks with distant reading analyses to enhance the close reading capabilities of the scholar. We suggest a design inspired by mind mapping (an example mind map is shown in Figure 4a), a methodology that allows a researcher to work on a central concept, and thoughts and features about that concept are placed around it using figures, lines etc. In a mind map, the associations spread out from a central concept in a free-flowing, yet organized and coherent manner (Budd, 2004) - thus forming a mental map of the central concept. We observe that like in the case of mind maps, fixed annotations around the central text in a traditional close reading process facilitate forming a mental map of the thoughts about the text of interest, and help the scholar to draw conclusions when seeing the whole picture.</p>

                <p>Figure 4b illustrates the idea of a mind map inspired interface with multiple types of annotations supporting the scholar in the close reading process. Textual annotations known from the traditional close reading are also necessary in the digital process. In addition, images, videos and charts can facilitate text interpretation and the generation of valuable hypotheses about the text. To support dynamic, multifarious views on a certain text passage or a term of interest, we designed our interface the way that the literary scholar can apply a multitude of visual analyses and generate distant reading visualizations that are placed as annotations alongside the text. This combines the traditional close reading paradigm with elaborated text visualization techniques valuable for exploration purposes. An important feature of our proposed interface design is to support the scholar to „stay in the flow“ (Bederson, 2004), so that the central focus remains on the text, which can be analyzed without interrupting the scholar. The major advantage of our design over existing tools that assist close reading tasks is interface versatility. For example, Voyant Tools (see Figure 3) provide a predefined set of visualizations based on text statistics. On the other hand, our design allows the scholar to choose an appropriate text visualization as an annotation alongside the text, which is based on a user-defined query on the text.. Therefore, the scholar can apply different text visualizations for different passages of the text to support a variety of close reading tasks. </p>
                <p>An example of the design discussed above is shown in Figure 5. The example from Figure 1 is annotated using different kinds of annotations. Like in other digital tools, certain topics of the text are annotated using colors. In addition, the character(s) Peggotty is marked and a panel shows thumbnail images based on a Google Images search. Also the relative word frequency chart of the term “Peggotty” in Chapter 2 is shown on the bottom left. Furthermore, on the left area, a TagPie (Jänicke et al., 2015a) showing the co-occurrences of both the terms memory and observation helps to investigate the hypothesis of the literary scholar about the similar meaning of both topics. The example depicts how the scholar can use different annotation tools as well as different distant reading tools to enrich the close reading experience.</p>

                <head>Future Work and Conclusions</head>
                <p>We held discussion with the collaborating humanities scholars about the design as well as the usability of the proposed interface. The scholars remarked that such an interface will help removing fears of using digital humanities tools and that they intend to use the tool as it mimics their existing workflows. They also mentioned that such a tool could help users getting a better big picture of the text, and that it enhances the close reading capabilities of the scholar. Another important point is the capability in supporting teaching activities. They mentioned that various types of annotations (text, pictures, charts) are also used in teaching material, but it is not easy to share these with students. Such a tool could support this process as it generates persistent annotations to be analyzed and discussed collaboratively in courses. </p>
                <p>We observe that the scholar’s initial reactions after seeing the prototype of the tool, which is still in development, are convincing and encouraging. We think that rigid modeling syntax is inappropriate for annotation. Our final interface will allow the scholar to make annotation styles versatile. At the digital humanities conference, we will demonstrate our prototype and discuss future prospects within the community. An additional user study will compare the viability of our proposed, mind map inspired annotation technique to existing approaches.</p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>Can we find and track theory, especially literary theory, in very large collections of texts using computers? This panel discusses a pragmatic two-step approach to trying to track and then visually explore theory through its textual traces in large collections like those of the HathiTrust.</p>

                    <item>
                        <hi rend=""bold"">Subsetting: </hi>The first problem we will discuss is how to extract thematic subsets of texts from very large collections like those of the HathiTrust. We experimented with two methods for identifying “theoretical” subsets of texts from large collections, using keyword lists and machine learning. The first two panel presentations will look at developing two different types of theoretical keyword lists. The third presentation will discuss a machine learning approach to extracting the same sorts of subsets.
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        <hi rend=""bold"">Topic Modelling: </hi>The second problem we tackled was what to do with such subsets, especially since they are likely to still be too large for conventional text analysis tools like Voyant (voyant-tools.org) and users will want to explore the results to understand what they got. The fourth panel presentation will therefore discuss how the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) adapted Topic Modelling tools to work on large collections to help exploring subsets. The fifth panel talk will then show an adapted visualization tool, the Galaxy Viewer, that allows one to explore the results of Topic Modelling. 
                    </item>
                </list>
                <p>The panel brings together a team of researchers who are part of the “Text Mining the Novel” (TMN) project that is funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and led by Andrew Piper at McGill University. Text Mining the Novel (novel-tm.ca) is a multi-year and multi-university cross-cultural study looking at the use of quantitative methods in the study of literature, with the HathiTrust Research Center is a project partner.</p>
                <p>The issue of how to extract thematic subsets from very large corpora such as the HathiTrust is a problem common to many projects that want to use diachronic collections to study the history of ideas or other phenomena. To conclude the panel, a summary reflective presentation will discuss the support the HTRC offers to DH researchers and how the HTRC notion of “worksets” can help with the challenges posed by creating useful subsets. It will further show how the techniques developed in this project can be used by the HTRC to help other future scholarly investigations.</p>

                <head>Using Word Lists to Subset</head>
                <p>Geoffrey Rockwell (Kevin Schenk, Zachary Palmer, Robert Budac and Boris Capitanu)</p>
                <p>How can one extract subsets from a corpus without appropriate metadata? Extracting subsets is a problem particular to very large corpora like those kept by the HathiTrust (www.hathitrust.org/). Such collections are too large to be manually curated and their metadata is of limited use in many cases. And yet, one needs ways to classify all the texts in a collection in order to extract subsets if one wants to study particular themes, genres or types of works. In our case we wanted to extract theoretical works which for the purpose of this project we defined as Philosophical works or Literary Critical works. In this first panel presentation we will discuss the use of keyword lists as a way of identifying a subset of “philosophical” texts.</p>
                <p>Why philosophical? We choose to experiment extracting philosophical texts first as philosophy is a discipline with a long history and a vocabulary that we hypothesized would lend itself to a keyword approach. Unlike more recent theoretical traditions, philosophical words might allow us to extract works from the HathiTrust going back thousands of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend=""bold"">Keywords. </hi>For the first part of this project we adapted a list of philosophical keywords from the Indiana Philosophy Ontology Project (inpho.cogs.indiana.edu/). Our adapted list has 4,437 words and names starting with ""abauzit"", ""abbagnano"", ""abdolkarim"", ""abduction"", ""abduh"", ""abel"", and so on. There are a number of ways of generating such lists of keywords or features, in our case we were able to start with a very large curated list. The second paper in this panel discusses generating a list of literary critical keywords.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend=""bold"">Process. </hi>We used this list with a process we wrote in Python that calculates the relative frequency of each word in a text and does this over a collection. The process also calculates the sum of the relative frequencies giving us a simple measurement of the use of philosophical keywords in a text. The word frequency process generates a CSV with the titles, author, frequency sum and individual keyword frequencies which can be checked and manipulated in Excel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend=""bold"">Testing.</hi> We iteratively tested this keyword approach on larger and larger collections. First we gathered a collection of 20 philosophical and 20 non-philosophical texts from Project Gutenberg (www.gutenberg.org/). We found the summed frequency accurately distinguished the philosophical from the non-philosophical texts. The process was then run by the HTRC on a larger collection of some 9,000 volumes and the results returned to us. We used the results to refine our list of keywords so that a summed relative frequency of .09 gave us mostly philosophical works with a few false positives. We did this by sorting the false positives by which words contributed to their summed relative frequency and then eliminating those words from the larger list that seemed to be ambiguous.
                </p>
                <p>The process was then run on the HathiTust Open Open collection of 254,000 volumes. This generated some 3230 volumes that had a summed relative frequency over .1, which seemed a safe cut-off point given how .09 had worked with a smaller collection. To assess the accuracy of this method we manually went through these 3,230 and categorized them using the titles producing a CSV that could be used with other classification methods.</p>

                    <graphic url=""622/image1.png"" rend=""inline""/>
                </figure>
                <p>The table below summarizes the categories of volumes that we found, though it should be noted that the categorization was based on the titles, which can be misleading. “Unsure” was for works which we weren’t sure about. “Not-Philosophical” were those works that we were reasonably sure were not philosophical from the title. The categories like Science and Education were for works about science and philosophy or education and philosophy.</p>

                <p>One of the things that stands out is the overlap between religious titles and philosophical ones. This is not surprising given that the fields have been intertwined for centuries and often treat of the same issues. We also note how many educational works and works dealing with society can have a philosophical bent. It was gratifying to find only 4.9% of the volumes classified seemed clearly not philosophical. If one includes the Unsure category it is 15.7%, but the Unsure category is in many ways the most interesting as one reason for classifying by computer is to find unexpected texts that challenge assumptions about what is theory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend=""bold"">Conclusions</hi>. Using large keyword lists to classify texts is a conceptually simple method that can be understood and used by humanists. We have lists of words and names at hand in specialized dictionaries and existing classification systems. Lists can be managed to suit different purposes. Our list from InPhO had the advantage that is was large and inclusive, but also the disadvantage that included words like “being” and “affairs” that have philosophical uses but are also used in everyday prose. The same is true of the names gathered like Croce that can refer to the philosopher or the cross (in Italian). Further trimming and then weighting of words/names could improve the classification of strictly philosophical texts. We also need to look deeper into the results to find not just the false positives, but also the true negatives. In sum, this method has the virtue of simplicity and accessibility and in the case of philosophical texts can be used to extract useful, though not complete, subsets.

                <head>The Problem with Literary Theory</head>
                <p>Laura Mandell (Boris Capitanu, Stefan Sinclair, and Susan Brown)</p>
                <p>In this short paper, I describe adapting the word list approach developed by Geoffrey Rockwell for extracting a subset of philosophical texts from a large, undifferentiated corpus, to the task of identifying works of literary theory. The degree to which running the list of terms did in fact pull out and gather together works of literary criticism and theory is very high, despite potential problems with such an enterprise, which we discuss in this talk in detail.</p>
                <list type=""ordered"">

                        <hi rend=""bold"">Developing the list of literary terms</hi>. Susan Brown and I decided to gather lists of literary terms. Susan initiated a discussion with the MLA about using terms from the 
                        <hi rend=""italic"">MLA Bibliography</hi> but upon consideration these were in fact not at all what we needed: they classified subjects of texts as opposed to listing terms that would appear in those texts. I had recently spent some time learning about JSTOR’s new initiative in which sets of terms are created by what they call “SMEs”--Subject Matter Experts--and then used to locate articles all participating in an interdisciplinary subject. Their first foray is available in Beta: it gathers together all articles in no matter what field on the topic of Environmental Sustainabilty (labs.jstor.org/sustainability/). The terms collected are terms that would appear 
                        <hi rend=""italic"">in</hi> the relevant texts, not in the metadata about them; the goal is to collect documents across multiple categories related to specialization, discipline, and field, since the desired result to gather together interdisciplinary texts concerning a common topic.

                        <hi rend=""bold"">Anachronism. </hi>JSTOR had started a “literary terms” list, and I finished the list of terms relying on encyclopedias of literary theory. Could a list of terms significant in the late-twentieth-century theories of literature as expressed in articles gathered in JSTOR be used to extract a set of texts published much earlier that analyze literature? What about the historical inaccuracy of using twentieth-century terms to find eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary criticism?

                </figure>
                <p>In fact, results show solidly that this anachronistic list of terms developed by experts do work to gather materials that preceded and fed into, served to develop, the discipline of literary theory. One of two falsely identified texts among the top relevant documents has to do with water distribution systems which had, as part of its most frequent terms, “meter” and “collection,” two terms relevant to analyzing the medium and content of poetry. Other false positives are similarly explicable, and, most important, they are rare.</p>
                <p>In this paper, we report upon the effects of running these frequent words on very large datasets using both unsupervised to supervised learning.</p>

                <head>Machine Learning</head>
                <p>Stefan Sinclair (and Matthew Wilkens)</p>
                <p>The third panel presentation deals with machine learning techniques to extract subsets. Unsupervised learning techniques allow us to evaluate the relative coherence of theoretical clusters within large textual fields and to identify distinct theoretical subclasses in the absence of any firmly established anatomy of the discipline. For these reasons, we performed unsupervised classification on three corpora: (1) A large collection (c. 250,000 volumes) of mixed fiction and nonfiction published in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. (2) A subset of that corpus identified by algorithmic and manual methods as highly philosophical. And (3) A subset similarly identified as literary-critical.</p>
                <p>In the case of the large corpus, the goal was to identify subsets containing high proportions of philosophy and criticism. For the smaller sets, we sought to produce coherent groupings of texts that would resemble subfields or concentrations within those areas. In each case, we extracted textual features including word frequency distributions, formal and stylistic measures, and basic metadata information, then performed both 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">k</hi>-means and DBSCAN clustering on the derived Euclidean distances between volumes.
                </p>
                <p>As in past work on literary texts (Wilkens, 105), we found that we were able to identify highly distinct groups of texts, often those dealing with specialized and comparatively codified subdomains, and that we could subdivide larger fields with reasonable but lower accuracy. The model that emerges from this work, however, is one emphasizing continuity over clear distinction. Subfields and areas of intensely shared textual focus do exist, but a systematic view of large corpora in the philosophical and literary critical domains suggests a more fluid conception of knowledge space in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p>
                <p>In parallel with the unsupervised classification performed – an attempt to allow distinctive features to emerge without, or with less, bias – we also performed supervised classification, starting with the training set of 40 texts labelled as Philosophical and Other (mentioned in ""Using Word Lists to Subset"" above). We experimented with several machine learning algorithms and several parameters to determine which ones seemed most suitable for our dataset. Indeed, part of this work was to recognize and and normalize the situation of the budding digital humanist confronting a dizzying array of choices: stoplists, keywords, relative frequencies, TF-IDF values, number of terms to use, Naïve Bayes Multinomial, 
                    <hi rend=""background(white)"">Linear Support Vector Classification, penalty parameter, iterations, and so on ad infinitum. Some testing is desirable; some guesswork and some craftwork are essential. We reflect on these tensions more in the iPython notebook (Sinclair et al., 2016) and we will discuss them during the presentation as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>One of the surprises from these initial experiments in machine learning was that using an unbiased list of terms from the full corpus (with stopwords removed) was considerably more effective than attempting to classify using the constrained philosophical vocabulary. Again, this may be because the keywords list was overly greedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend=""background(white)"">Just as we experimented with ever-larger corpora for the ""Using Lists to Subset"" sub-project, the supervised learning subproject broadened its scope gradually in an attempt to identify theoretical texts unknown to us while examining the efficacy of the methodologies along the way. Indeed, the overarching purpose of adopting all three approaches (keyword-based, unsupervised classification, machine learning) was to compare and contrast different ways of studying theory in a large-scale corpus.</hi>

                <head>Working with HTRC datasets</head>
                <p>Boris Capitanu</p>
                <p>The fourth panel presentation focuses on working with the HathiTrust and the particular format of HathiTrust texts. Researchers may obtain datasets directly from HathiTrust [1] by making a special request, after having fulfilled appropriate security and licensing requirements. Datasets in HathiTrust and HTRC are available in two different ways:</p>
                <list type=""unordered"">
                    <item>via rsync in Pairtree format</item>
                    <item>via Data API</item>
                </list>
                <p>According to “Pairtrees for Object Storage (V0.1)” [2], the Pairtree is ""a filesystem hierarchy for holding objects that are located within that hierarchy by mapping identifier strings to object directory (or folder) paths, two characters at a time”. In the HathiTrust, the objects consist of the individual volume and associated metadata. Volumes are stored as ZIP files containing text files, one text file for each page, where the text file is named by the page number. A volume ZIP file may contain additional non-page text files, whose purpose can be identified from the file name. The metadata for the volume is encoded in METS XML [3] and lives in a file next to the volume ZIP file. For example, a volume with id “loc.ark:/13960/t8pc38p4b” is stored in Pairtree as:</p>
                <p>loc/pairtree_root/ar/k+/=1/39/60/=t/8p/c3/8p/4b/ark+=13960=t8pc38p4b/ark+=13960=t8pc38p4b.zip loc/pairtree_root/ar/k+/=1/39/60/=t/8p/c3/8p/4b/ark+=13960=t8pc38p4b/ark+=13960=t8pc38p4b.mets.xml</p>
                <p>where “loc” represents the 3-letter code of the library of origin (in this case Library of Congress). As mentioned, the volume ZIP files contain text files named for the page number. For example, here are the first few entries when listing the contents of the above ZIP file:</p>
                <p> ark+=13960=t8pc38p4b/</p>
                <p> ark+=13960=t8pc38p4b/00000001.txt</p>
                <p> ark+=13960=t8pc38p4b/00000002.txt</p>
                <p> ark+=13960=t8pc38p4b/00000003.txt</p>
                <p> …</p>
                <p>Note that the strings that encode the volume id and the ZIP filename are different. Before a volume id can be encoded as a file name, it goes through a “cleaning” process that converts any character that is not a valid character to be used in a filename into one that is (for example “:” was converted to “+” and “/” to “=“), also dropping the 3-letter library code. The specific conversion rules are obscure, but library code already exists [4][5] for multiple languages that is able to perform this conversion both ways.</p>
                <p>The pairtree is an efficient structure for storing a large number of files. However, working with this structure can pose certain challenges. One of the issues is that this deeply nested folder hierarchy is slow to traverse. Applications needing to recursively process the volumes in a particular dataset stored in pairtree will have to traverse a large number of folders to “discover” every volume. A second inconvenience stems from the use of ZIP to store the content of a volume. While efficient in terms of disk space usage, it’s inconvenient when applications need to process the text data of the volume as they would need to uncompress the ZIP file and read its contents, in the proper order, concatenating all pages, in order to obtain the entire volume text content. A further complication is due to the fact that the exact ordering and naming of the page text files in the ZIP file is only provided as part of the METS XML metadata file. So, if the goal is to create a large blob of text containing all the pages of a volume (and only the pages, in the proper order, without any additional non-page data), the most correct way of doing so is to first parse the METS XML to determine the page sequence and file names, and then uncompress the ZIP file concatenating the pages in the exact sequence specified. This, of course, has a large performance penalty if it needs to be done on a large dataset every time this dataset is used to address some research question.</p>
                <p>An alternative way to obtain a particular dataset is to use the Data API [6]. Currently, access to Data API is limited, and is allowed only from the Data Capsule [7] while in Secure Mode. Using the Data API a researcher can retrieve multiple volumes, pages of volumes, token counts, and METS metadata documents. Authentication via the OAuth protocol is required when making requests to the Data API. The advantage of using the Data API in place of the pairtree (other than disk storage savings) is that one can request already-concatenated text blobs for volumes, and make more granular requests for token counts or page ranges without having to traverse deeply-nested folder structures or parse METS metadata.</p>
                <p>In this panel presentation we will show how the tools developed for the Trace of Theory project were adapted to work with the Pairtree format. The goal is to help others be able to work with the HathiTrust data format.</p>

                <head>Topic Modelling and Visualization for Exploration</head>
                <p>Susan Brown (Geoffrey Rockwell, Boris Capitanu, Ryan Chartier, and John Montague)</p>
                <p>When working with very large collections even subsets can be too large to manage with conventional text analysis tools. Further, one needs ways of exploring the results of extraction techniques to figure out if you got what you were expecting or something surprising in an interesting way. In the fifth panel presentation we will discuss the adaptation of a tool called the Galaxy Viewer for visualizing the results of Topic Modelling (Montague et al., 2015). Topic modeling is an automated text mining technique that has proven popular in the humanities that tries to identify groups of words with a tendency to occur together within the same documents in a corpus. Chaney and Blei explain that, “One of the main applications of topic models is for exploratory data analysis, that is, to help browse, understand, and summarize otherwise unstructured collections.” (Chaney et al., 2012)</p>
                <figure>
                    <graphic url=""622/image3.png"" rend=""inline""/>
                </figure>
                <p>The Galaxy Viewer prototype was developed to explore the results of topic modelling over large collections. It combines different views so that one can select topics, compare topics, explore the words in topics, follow topic tokens over time, and see the document titles associated with topics. In this presentation we will demonstrate the Galaxy Viewer and then discuss how it was scaled to handle much larger collections.</p>
                <p>The prototype Galaxy Viewer backend code uses Mallet (McCallum, 2002) to infer the set of topics, topic distributions per document, and word probabilities per topic. Unfortunately, Mallet is meant to be used on small- to medium-sized corpora as it requires that the entire dataset be loaded into RAM during training. An additional constraint with Mallet is the fact that although Mallet can fully utilize all the CPU cores on a single machine, it’s not designed to work in a distributed-computing fashion across a number of machines, to speed up execution. As such, processing very large datasets (if even possible) might take a very long time (as the algorithm makes multiple passes over the entire dataset). Many implementations of LDA exist, which primarily fall into one of two categories: Batch LDA, or Online LDA. The core difference between batch and online LDA stems from what happens during each iteration of the algorithm. In batch mode, as mentioned earlier, each iteration of the algorithm makes a full pass over all the documents in the dataset in order to re-estimate the parameters, checking each time for convergence. In contrast, online LDA only makes a single sweep over the dataset, analyzing a subset of the documents each iteration. The memory requirement for online LDA depends on the chosen batch size only, not on the size of the dataset - as is the case with batch LDA.</p>
                <p>We are currently in the process of researching/comparing the available implementations of LDA to establish which one would be best suited to use for the Galaxy Viewer. We are also considering the option of not fixing the LDA implementation, but instead make the backend flexible so that any LDA implementation can be used (as long as it provides the appropriate results that are needed). In the latter case we’d have to create specific result interpreters that can translate the output from the specific implementation of LDA to the appropriate format to be used to store in the database (to be served by the web service).</p>
                <p>Given that Topic Modeling results do not expose the textual content of the documents analyzed, and cannot be used to reconstruct the original text, they are safe to be publicly shared without fear of violating copyright law. This is great news for researchers working with collections like those of the HathiTrust as they should be able to gain insight into datasets which are still currently in-copyright and would, otherwise, not be available to be inspected freely.</p>
                <p>In the prototype Galaxy Viewer implementation, the output of the topic modeling step is processed through a set of R functions that reshape the data and augment it with additional calculated metrics that are used by the web frontend to construct the visualization. These post-processing results are saved to the filesystem as a set of five CSV files. One of these CSV files is quite large as it contains the topic modeling state data from Mallet (containing topic assignments for each document and word, and associated frequency count). The visual web frontend code loads this set of five files into memory when the interface is accessed the first time, which can take several minutes. For the prototype this approach was tolerated, but it has serious scalability and performance issue that needs to be addressed before the tool can be truly usable by other researchers.</p>
                <p>Scaling the Galaxy Viewer therefore consists of creating a web service backed with a (NoSQL) database which will service AJAX requests from the front-end for the data needed to construct the topic visualization and related graphs. We are developing the set of service calls that need to be implemented/exposed by the web service to fulfill the needs of the front-end web-app. The backend service will query the database to retrieve the necessary data to service the requests. The database will be created based on the output of the Topic Modeling process, after required post-processing of the results is completed (to calculate the topic trends, topic distances, and other metrics used in the display). Relevant metadata at the volume and dataset level will also be stored to be made available to the front-end upon request. This work will be completed by the end of December 2015 so that it can be demonstrated in the new year. The scaled Galaxy Viewer will then provide a non-consumptive way of allowing users of the HathiTrust to explore the copyrighted collections. Extraction of subsets and Topic Modelling can take place under the supervision of the HTRC and the results database can then be exposed to visualization tools like the Galaxy Viewer (and others) for exploration.</p>

                <p>The HathiTrust Research Center exists to give the Digital Humanities community analytic access to the HathiTrust’s 13.7 million volumes. The HT volumes comprise over 4.8 billion pages each in turn represented by a high-resolution image file and two OCR files yielding some 14.4 billion data files! Thus, as the earlier papers have highlighted, the sheer size of the collection, along with the idiosyncratic nature of the HT data, together create several hurdles that impede meaningful analytic research.The HTRC is engaged in two ongoing endeavours designed to assist DH researchers in overcoming these obstacles: The Advance Collaborative Support (ACS) program [1]; and, the Workset Creation for Scholarly Analysis (WCSA) project [2]. </p>
                <p>The ACS program at HTRC provides no-cost senior developer time, data wrangling assistance, computation time and analytic consultations to DH researchers who are prototyping new research ideas using the HT data resources. The ACS program is an integral part of the HTRC’s operation mission and was part of its value-added proposition when the HTRC launched its recent four-year operations plan (2014-2018). It is a fundamental component of the HTRC’s outreach activities and as such, has staff dedicated to its planning, management and day-to-delivery. The ACS team was responsible for creating, and then reviewing, the competitive ACS Request for Proposals (RFP) that ask interested DH researchers outline their intellectual goals, describe their data needs, and estimate their computational requirements. The ACS team is generally looking for new projects that could benefit from some kickstarting help from HTRC. HTRC welcomes proposals from researchers with a wide range of experience and skills. Projects run 6 to 12 months.</p>
                <p>Originally funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (2013-2015), the current WCSA program is building upon, extending and implementing the development made during the funding period. The HTRC project team, along with subaward collaborators at University of Oxford, University of Maryland, Texas Agriculture and Marine University and University of Waikato, developed a group of prototype techniques for empowering scholars who want to do computational analyses of the HT materials to more efficiently and effectively create user-specific analytic subsets (called “worksets”). A formal model has been designed to describe the items in a workset along with necessary bibliographic and provenance metadata that is now being incorporated into the HTRC infrastructure (Jett, 2015). </p>
                <p>The Trace of Theory project was selected from the first round of ACS proposals. This concluding panel presentation will discuss in what ways the Trace of Theory project has been both a representative and a unique exemplar of the ACS program. It will present some emergent themes that evolved from the HTRC-Trace of Theory interactions that we believe will have an important influence on the delivery of future ACS projects. In the same manner, it will reflect upon the problems the team of researchers had in subsetting the data to build their necessary worksets along with the solutions that the HRTC-Trace of Theory collaboration developed to surmount those difficulties. The panel will finish with a summary of how HTRC intends to incorporate the lessons learned into its day-to-day operations as well as future ACS projects. </p>

            <p>Summary: This poster presents work on documenting user needs in the Humanities and Social Sciences as illustrated through Case Studies in the context of the Europeana Cloud “Unlocking Europe's Research via the Cloud” project. Conducted as part of a wider methodological effort including desk research, expert fora and a web survey, methodology and findings of actual use of innovative digital tools and services will be visually represented. This work will form the basis of the Europeana Research Case Studies which will seek to gather and process an evidence-based record of the information practices, needs and scholarly methods in the respective communities.</p>
            <p>This poster reports on collaborative, cross-European work conducted during 2013-2015 in the context of the Europeana Cloud “Unlocking Europe's Research via the Cloud” project, and touches upon planned activities in the context of Europeana Research in 2016. Europeana Research is an initiative which aims to create stronger links between the cultural heritage sector and academia. More particularly, it aims to ensure that open, high-quality data from the cultural sector is available for reuse by the digital humanities community.</p>
            <p>One of the main objectives of Europeana Cloud was the enhancement of the understanding of digital tools, research processes and scholarly content used in the Humanities and Social Sciences, thus informing the development of tools and aggregation of content in Europeana for research purposes. To this end, and in order to contribute towards the development of the new platform of Europeana Research, Case Studies were developed as part of a wider methodological effort which included desk research, expert fora and web survey for reaching user requirements.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this poster is to visually represent the methodology followed and results reached in documenting actual use of innovative digital tools and services in the Humanities and Social Sciences research communities illustrated in three main Case Studies in the disciplines of Education, Art History and Sociology, and further complemented by satellite cases. </p>
            <p>The Case Studies were initially selected based on the disciplines and tools that might best make use of current Europeana content. By defining “innovative” as “either performing functions that were previously unavailable, or performing already available functions in a qualitatively different way”, three tools were identified as best fitting this criteria (Transana, HyperImage, NodeXL) enriched by two “satellite” tools more frequently used in the respective research disciplines (NVivo, Voyant).</p>
            <p>These were further approached following a threefold methodology of semi-structured interviews, empirical observation of the tools and background research. The results were then discussed both from the perspective of the discipline area, and through the lens of the scholarly primitives (Unsworth 2000, Palmer et al 2009), to determine their use with Europeana content. The poster will also highlight the importance of accessibility of data for research infrastructures and research groups and need to focus on high quality metadata and content both for Europeana Research and the wider GLAM sector, and will illustrate how digital tools are not themselves a guarantee of good research, as researchers do not necessarily use the same digital tool throughout the research process; rather they use one tool per step (one tool = one research primitive).</p>
            <p>This poster will also present future work planned to be undertaken in the context of Europeana Research in 2016. Based on Europeana Cloud, a series of new Case Studies will be developed and expanded towards different research communities. The Europeana Research Case Studies will be undertaken in collaboration with existing European research initiatives, and will seek to gather and process an evidence-based record of the information practices, needs and scholarly methods of arts and humanities and social sciences researchers within the broad Europeana ecosystem and particularly in relation to Europeana content. Τhe Case Studies will employ a mixed methods approach combining various ways of gathering empirical evidence on the information needs and scholarly methods employed in digitally-enabled arts and humanities and social sciences research across Europe and beyond.</p>

        <body>
            <p>“Remapping Leigh Hunt’s Circles” is an ambitious project that explores Leigh Hunt’s central position in the London literary and critical scene of the first half of the nineteenth century, through the lens of digital humanities tools. Hunt is today considered one of the key figures of the Romantic period in England, known for his work as editor, journalist, poet, and facilitator. Numerous articles, essay collections, biographies, and monographs published in the last fifteen years have made this clear. Hunt's contribution to Romantic and Victorian literature was as extensive as it has proven durable, in matters as various as prosodic experimentation and the modernization of the magazine essay. Yet little work (beyond some biographical notes) has been done on the second half of his life, a period that was as productive as the first, and during which Hunt was intimate with many of the finest writers of the time, and continued to contribute to London’s literary circles through the ongoing publication of critical essays in periodicals and anthologies. This project aims to redress this imbalance/oversight and reassert Hunt’s place in the Romantic and Victorian eras, as well as his continuing significance for understanding the London literary scene between 1805 (publication of his first critical essay) and 1859 (date of his death, with his last article published only a few weeks before). </p>
            <p>“Remapping Leigh Hunt’s Circles” makes a case for Hunt’s position as a key critical voice in London beyond his already established prominence during the 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Examiner</hi> years. It does so through a careful analysis of his critical reviews and essays (with a specific focus on his drama criticism to underscore Hunt’s ongoing engagement with the public sphere) published during his entire career, which spanned the first half of the nineteenth century. Data mining and textual analysis offer exciting opportunities to bring together different sets of data which, when prepared to the highest standard of text encoding, can yield new and innovative results that encourage reconsideration of preconceived notions regarding the transfer of ideas from one author to another, or one literary genre to another. The results of the research undertaken in “Remapping Leigh Hunt’s Circles” will be presented in a collaborative, visual context that reimagines the digital scholarly edition as a transparent workspace in which established primary objects from existing databases can be gathered, organized, correlated, annotated, and augmented by multiple users in a dynamic environment. 
            </p>
            <p>All the texts prepared for inclusion in our project are encoded to the Text-Encoding-Initiative (TEI) standards. The mark-up language and quality controls for improving metadata in all the resources provide more accurate search and discovery, allow for the presentation of well-supported content on multiple devices and develop tools for assembling, archiving and indexing research objects and artifacts. Ongoing work on this platform will enable researchers to undertake world-class research by providing the means to link data-sets to published content, encouraging data reanalysis, replication studies, and data re-purposing, all of which improve research quality and efficiency.</p>
            <p>Our poster will report on the first year of this project, and the implementation of the latest version of the 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Voyant Tools</hi> to examine the dramatic essays written by Hunt between 1805 and 1813 (when he was sentenced to two years in prison for libel against the Prince Regent). We will showcase in particular two aspects of the integration between the Hunt archives and Voyant Tools. First, the ability to identify and visualize named entity connections and their networks across multiple documents (this a refinement of the previous RezoViz tool in Voyant). The Hunt collection presents an ideal corpus for network exploration given the interconnectedness of the people, locations and events that animate the documents. Second, Voyant provides a generic and customizable way of presenting a web-based corpus catalogue with the same kinds of faceted browsing and advanced querying capabilities we have come to expect from library databases and online stores. A further benefit of this functionality is the ability to create dynamic subsets of a corpus to examine more closely (in other words, using a catalogue skin in Voyant to create worksets destined for Voyant’s more conventional analytic skin).
            </p>
            <p>The “Remapping Leigh Hunt’s Circles” is essentially a project of digital text editing and literary criticism whereas Voyant Tools is essentially a software platform for reading, analyzing and visualizing digital texts. These are separate traditions and separate concerns, but this poster will demonstrate the value of symbiotic development: both projects benefit from the collaboration.</p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>The HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) aims to facilitate large-scale computational text analysis of the contents of the HathiTrust Digital Library (HTDL) through data services and analytical tools. We conducted a study of current and potential users of the HTRC to investigate how scholars integrate text analysis into their research. Our study aims to inform the development of HTRC services and also to generate deeper insights into scholarly research practices with large-scale digitized text corpora.</p>
            </div>
            <div type=""div1"" rend=""DH-Heading1"">
                <head>Background</head>
                <p>Studies on the use of digital content by humanities scholars, ranging from humanities cyberinfrastructure (ACLS, 2006) and patterns in scholarly practices (Brockman et al., 2001; Palmer and Neumann, 2002; Green and Courtney, 2015), to discipline-specific studies (Zorich, 2012; Babeu, 2011; Rutner and Schonfeld, 2011), reveal that scholars acquire and analyze digital content in multi-faceted ways. Several investigations particularly examine scholarly uses of digital tools (Frischer et al., 2006; Toms and O’Brien, 2008; Gibbs and Owens, 2012). Computational text analysis dates from the beginnings of humanities computing (Hindley, 2013), and the resources of the ARTFL Project (Argamon et al., 2009; Horton et al., 2009), MONK (Unsworth, 2011), Wordseer (Muralidharan and Hearst, 2013), Voyant and TaPOR (Rockwell et al., 2010), and Lexos (LeBlanc et al., 2013), among others, inform the current work of the HTRC to provide a secure computational and data environment for researchers to conduct analyses of content from the HathiTrust Digital Library.</p>
                <p>Our study builds on an earlier user needs assessment conducted for the HTRC and its Mellon Foundation-funded Workset Creation for Scholarly Analysis project. That earlier study analyzed interviews and focus groups in order to identify capabilities needed in large text corpora to facilitate scholarly research use (Fenlon et al., 2014). These desired capabilities included the ability to create and manipulate collections as reusable datasets and research products, the ability to work at different units of analysis, and access to highly enriched metadata (Green et al., 2014; Fenlon et al., 2014). </p>
                <p>Our present study especially builds upon that previous investigation by examining the text analysis research practices of current and potential users of the HTRC.</p>

                    <head>Methods</head>
                    <p>We conducted fifteen semi-structured interviews with students, faculty, researchers, administrators, and librarians who pursue work that includes text analysis, or have familiarity with text analysis methods. Some participants were recruited at professional conferences for digital humanities and libraries, while others were active in HTRC user group forums. Several of the interviewees had previously interacted with the HTRC, and most had experience with the HTDL. The participants were from various disciplines — including English, Anthropology, History, and Computer Science —and ranged from newcomers to digital humanities to long-time researchers. </p>
                    <p>We performed an initial analysis of the interview data through open coding and will continue detailed qualitative analysis using ATLAS.ti. Data was independently coded by the authors to ensure inter-coder reliability. While we are still actively analyzing interview data, we identified several preliminary themes discussed here. These themes include strategies for obtaining and managing data, research workflows and results, collaborations, and teaching. </p>

                    <head>Data Acquisition and Management</head>
                    <p>Several respondents characterized text analysis research as being time-intensive in spite of the speed of computational tools. One interviewee noted, ‘It’s funny, often people think, “Oh we have it digitized, now it’s useful.” Scholars realize that you have a lot more work to do after that. And that can often slow projects down terribly.’</p>
                    <p>The interviewees indicated that gathering, managing, and manipulating text data comprised a considerable portion of their work. An interviewee explained, ‘I think the biggest challenge is data, getting good data to work with. I think people underestimate the problems and difficulties in doing that.’</p>
                    <p>Interviewees also expressed a desire for improved ways to identify and extract the content they needed, especially when navigating large-scale collections to find the volumes, pages, or passages relevant to a research project. As one interviewee remarked, ‘Even if you had somehow structured your texts, I would be saying, “What was left out? How do I bring it back in?”’ </p>
                </div>
                <div type=""div2"" rend=""DH-Heading2"">
                    <head>Research Workflows and Results</head>
                    <p>Several interviewees described the potential of text analysis to challenge previously held understandings of text, as differences between human and computational readings emerged. One respondent noted, ‘There are many cases in which the computer is at least as good—if not better—a reader than humans are. That’s very difficult for people to accept... sometimes the computer gets it right and it bears looking at that difference. So we kind of want to get that new ground truth on this kind of work.’</p>
                    <p>Many researchers highlighted the importance of interpretive work in understanding how the tools interact with the text, and characterized the interactions as dynamic. One respondent observed, ‘I yearn for workflows where the scholar could actually set their own tokenization rules.... It would be a way that we could create less language-specific [rules] or control the language specificity of the algorithm. I think that is the real need.’ Several respondents highlighted the importance of tools that flexibly fit into various stages of the research process, and also are accessible to users of different skill levels. Interviewees also suggested enhancements specific to the HTRC, which included expanded visualization capabilities, improved generation of statistics about text corpora, and better ability to handle languages other than English. </p>

                <div type=""div2"" rend=""DH-Heading2"">
                    <head>Research Collaborations</head>
                    <p>Interviewees repeatedly cited collaboration and research support, both virtual and in-person, as important. Many interviewees worked with digital humanities initiatives, and reported that their local resources ranged from limited technical support to well-resourced research centers. For some interviewees, online support communities— such as Digital Humanities Questions and Answers or Stack Overflow — also were significant.</p>
                    <p>Interdisciplinary collaborations between departments and across institutions emerged as the most prominent kind of partnership, but interviewees also noted the challenges that such collaborations pose. As one interviewee explained, ‘Collaborations between institutions: much more difficult. There’s money, there’s institutional blockages, and then anything over half a dozen people, it gets complicated very quickly. And so the people dynamics get very complicated.’ Some respondents noted that these collaborations affected their research practices and acquisition of research resources. </p>
                    <p> Interviewees reported that their collaborations with libraries ranged from non-existent to critical partnerships. Many saw the library as a key space because ‘the library is actually the one functioning interdisciplinary space on a university campus.’ Collaborations with the HTRC and digital repositories for working with data also were important to respondents.</p>

                <div type=""div2"" rend=""DH-Heading2"">
                    <head>Teaching and Training</head>
                    <p>Interviewees mentioned their active efforts and intentions to incorporate computational text analysis into their teaching. Some remarked on institutional constraints that make it difficult to incorporate computational tools into curricula. As one respondent explained: ‘I once imagined teaching a class in which students learn to script and actually run analyses against data, but I was told, basically, that that class isn’t a humanities class anymore—that belongs in computer science.’</p>
                    <p>Some stated that the courses that they currently teach may not require or allow for the incorporation of computational analysis. Yet others noted that there is only a limited amount of technical or scientific skills that a humanities student could realistically master within a short period of time, with one interviewee noting that ‘you can only get people to learn so much about the math; as much as they can learn, they should — at the same time, it’s hard.’</p>
                    <p> Although the demand from students for learning about computational text analysis was, overall, reported to be increasing, some interviewees noted that they are constrained by not only limited resources, but also uncertainty as to how to carry out such activities. One interviewee reported prevailing sentiments that the digital humanities ‘doesn’t even fit anywhere,’ leading to the question of whether ‘there should be a whole separate department that’s digital humanities,’ or to offer training within existing curricula.</p>

                <p> The immediate aims of this study are to generate an updated framework of user requirements that will guide the development of the HTRC’s educational programming and research support services and also to inform forthcoming Mellon Foundation-funded development of the HTRC Data Capsule. But our preliminary findings also provide insights into scholars’ needs as they increasingly incorporate text analysis in research and teaching. These findings also reveal how digital scholarship centers, information professionals, and providers of digitized content can best support scholarship as digital humanities resources evolve.</p>

                <head>Newspaper archives as a linguistic corpus</head>
                <p>This research investigates methods to study linguistic evolution using a corpus of scanned newspapers. We use a corpus of 4 million press articles covering about 200 years of archives, thus documenting indirectly the evolution of written language. The corpus is made out of digitized facsimiles of 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">Le Journal de Genève</hi> (1826–1997) and 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">La Gazette de Lausanne</hi> (1804–1997). For each journal, the daily scanned issues were algorithmically transcribed using an OCR system. The whole archive represents more than 20 TB of scanned data and contains about two billion words, putting it beyond the capabilities of most usual analysis techniques for regular desktop computers.
                </p>
                <p>The corpus can be easily divided into subsets corresponding to the year of publication. However, the number of pages and their content fluctuates greatly depending on the year, ranging from 280’000 in the early 19th century to about 18 million in the later years of the 20th century. Figure 1 shows the relative size of each subset in terms of number of words for 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">Le Journal de Genève</hi> (JDG) and 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">La Gazette de Lausanne</hi> (GDL).

                <p>Considering the lack of data for 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">Le Journal de Genève</hi> for the years 1837, 1917, 1918 and 1919, we left those out in all further graphs and analytics. In addition, some years had to be removed because the scanning quality was too poor (1834, 1835, 1859 and 1860 for JDG and 1808 for GDL).

                <head>Lexical kernels: Definition and basic measures</head>
                <p>A straightforward approach to the problem consists in computing a textual distance between subsets of the corpora. One could, for instance, easily compute the so-called Jaccard distance (Jaccard 1901, Jaccard 1912) between two consecutive vocabularies. In the same way, other distances could also be tried, such as those given by Kullback and Leibler (1951), Kullback (1987), Chi-squared distance (Sakoda, 1981), and Cosine similarity (Singhal, 2001).</p>
                <p>
                    <anchor xml:id=""h.jcb96tq89fen""/>However, the uneven distribution of the corpus subsets (Figure 1) causes methodological difficulties for interpreting these distances. An increase in the lexicon size causes an indirect increase in the linguistic drift as measured by the Jaccard formula (Sternitzke and Bergmann, 2009). Under such conditions, it is difficult to untangle the effects of the unevenness of the distribution of subsets of the corpus from the actual appearance and disappearance of words.
                </p>
                <p>These difficulties of interpretation motivate the exploration of another, possibly sounder approach to the same problem. Let us define a

However, these studies should be conducted with sound methodologies in order to avoid misinterpretation of artifacts. Common pitfalls include misinterpreting results linked to the size variation of the subsets or overgeneralizing results obtained on one particular newspaper corpus to general linguistic evolution.</p>
                <p>In this paper, we have introduced the notion of a kernel as a possible approach to study linguistic changes under the lens of linguistic stability. Focusing on stable words and their relative distribution is likely to make interpretations more robust.</p>
                <p>Results were computed on two independent corpora. It is striking to see that most of the results obtained are extremely similar for both. The kernels composition in terms of grammatical word typologies is very similar. Results in terms of word resilience are also similar. This suggests that our methods are indeed measuring general linguistic phenomena beyond the specificity of the corpora chosen for this study. However, this still needs to be confirmed with subsequent studies involving other corpora, such as non-journalistic texts and texts in other languages.</p>

        <body>
            <p>Writing in 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Literary and Linguistic Computing</hi>, Julianne Nyhan et al argue that “without a better understanding—a more appropriate term might be “body of interpretations”—of the near and distant history of computing in the humanities, we are condemned to repeat the revolutionary trope 
                <hi rend=""italic"">ad infinitum</hi>.” (Nyhan, Flinn, and Welsh, 2013). Willard McCarty, amplifying this, writes that “rather than hypnotizing ourselves with supposedly unprecedented marvels, we must learn to see computing in its historical and social contexts, and so be able to ground modelling in something larger than itself. For computing to be 
                <hi rend=""italic"">of</hi> the humanities as well as 
                <hi rend=""italic"">in</hi> them, we must get beyond catalogues, chronologies, and heroic firsts to a genuine history. There are none yet.” (McCarty, 2008). 
            </p>
            <p>Susan Hockey wrote in 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Companion to Digital Humanities</hi> that “humanities computing has a very well-known beginning,” by which she means the decades-long collaboration between Father Roberto Busa and IBM to create a concordance of the work of Thomas Aquinas (Hockey, 2004). This is the heroic first, which Busa, writing in the forward of that same volume, summed up with admirable brevity: “During the World War II, between 1941 and 1946, I began to look for machines for the automation of the linguistic analysis of written texts. I found them, in 1949, at IBM in New York City.”
                <hi rend=""superscript"">_</hi> This narrative is familiar to many of those working in digital humanities today, and has become openly accepted as the standard historical background for, first, humanities computing and, subsequently, the digital humanities writ large. 
            </p>
            <p>This presentation aims to upset this easy narrative by re-situating the history of one type of digital humanities project—Early English Books Online—as one chapter in an overall history of a technological humanities. That history—the history of a technological humanities—the story of how academics have deployed technology to better understand human creations, especially in textual form—or to understand and explore texts—did not begin in 1949. The creation of digital humanities, radiating outward from those early years, is surely part of the larger story of how technology and text have come together and drifted apart over many centuries. I claim that there is a great deal more continuity in the apparatuses, in the knowledge infrastructure of the humanities than we put forward in our “official” histories. In our search for a neat disciplinary history, we elide technology as a whole with the digital electronic computer. Busa’s project likely does represent the beginning of one type of computational textual processing. It bears remembering, however, that his goal was to create a concordance, a type of reference tool and interface in existence in Western Europe since at least the 13th century. What is the history of 
                <hi rend=""italic"">this</hi> type of textual processing in the intervening six hundred years? 
            </p>
            <p>Instead of a history of tools for textual work beginning with the rise of humanities computing and moving forward to the present day, I hope to juxtapose a different narrative, one that troubles the rhetoric of a textual digital humanities that arises from a clear break with what came before. I hope to, perhaps polemically, test the boundaries of histories of digital humanities by considering an equally technologically sophisticated pre-digital humanities. Such a reframing opens many avenues of inquiry, including a consideration of Linked Open Data in the context of cooperative cataloguing practices from the 19th & 20th centuries, or contemporary textual analysis tools such as Voyant alongside the imposing machinery of an electromechanical Hinman Collator. This presentation, however, will highlight particularly those technologies of textual reproduction developed prior to the oft-quoted originary moment of 1949. Drawing on the history of Early English Books Online (EEBO), I argue that while a 
                <hi rend=""italic"">computational </hi>humanities may indeed be limited to the last half-century, the 
                <hi rend=""italic"">technological </hi>humanities—in both materialist and cultural senses—have a much longer history.

            <p>The history of EEBO crosses multiple media, was directly impacted by global war, involves private companies and public universities, and is both analog and digital. To bracket EEBO (or EEBO-TCP) as a only a digital project impoverishes our understanding of how digital technologies have impacted the reproduction, preservation, and use of texts in humanistic scholarship. To write the full history of the early English books project, Early English Books Online, the Early English Books Online Text Creation Partnership is to engage in an act of disciplinary archaeology, one that forces digital humanists to grapple with the pre-digital origins and ideologies that inflect contemporary digital resources undergirding scholarship. EEBO is a microcosm through which one body of interpretations of digital humanities might be seen. </p>
            <p>As much as it is a history, this presentation is also engaged in answering claims by Alan Liu and Tara McPherson, amongst others, that digital humanities has chosen disciplinarily to disengage from socio-critical questions.

        <body>
            <p>Digital Humanities has seen slow adoption in the Slavic language and literature fields in North American academia. This issue frames our project, the Digital Émigré, a digital resource for exploring Russian émigré periodical literature. Our project has a threefold aim. As periodical studies scholars, we want to enable access to Russian émigré journals for new audiences. As digital humanists, we believe that DH tools and methodologies can facilitate new forms of knowledge about twentieth-century Russian, and more broadly diaspora, literary and cultural history. Finally, as Slavists, we hope our project will be a hub for discussion about the applicability of DH theory and practice for scholars working with Russian-language material.</p>
            <p>At this pilot stage, Digital Émigré is a web-based searchable database of article-level metadata of Russian-language journals published outside of Russia in the twentieth century. Our pilot contains four titles (approximately 100 issues and 1,500 articles): 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Novoselye</hi> and 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Novyi zhurnal</hi> were published in the 1940s in New York, and 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Sintaksis</hi> and 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Kontinent</hi>, in the late 1970s and 1980s in Paris. Our pilot site provides insight into literary culture at both the beginning and end of the Cold War, bookending the twentieth-century Russian diaspora experience. Digital Émigré is intended to scale, and will eventually contain additional titles and new functionality. 
            </p>
            <p>We will highlight the main scholarly avenues that DH methods allow us investigate, such as mapping networks of co-publication, tracking evolving political, social and cultural concerns of émigrés over the course of the Cold War, demonstrating the increased opportunities for émigré women as editors and contributors, and highlighting the proportion of original vs. re-printed work in émigré publications. This way, our project encourages experimentation that will enrich the study of Slavic periodical culture: accessing journals through their data can challenge narratives that are often framed by retroactive canonization, close reading and focus on individual authors. Digital Émigré thereby bridges philological approaches and sociological questions about intellectual networks and communities of artistic production. </p>
            <p>The poster address the project’s core technical design: our strategy for data modeling and management and database design.  We will also present our plans for next steps, which is to provide full-text access and to federate our titles with other digital periodical collections. For this, we are designing a TEI schema modeled on major periodical studies digital collections -  specifically the Blue Mountain Project at Princeton University (
                <ref target=""http://bluemountain.princeton.edu"">http://bluemountain.princeton.edu</ref> and the Yellow 90’s Online at Ryerson University (
                <ref target=""http://www.1890s.ca"">http://www.1890s.ca</ref>)  
            </p>
            <p>We will also discuss the specific challenges of working with Russian language material and Cyrillic script, such as character encoding, transliteration, translation, and  tokenizing and stemming. These issues can be barriers to success when working with popular DH tools that are developed primarily for Western scripts and languages, and we will show our solutions for using some well-known tools for: data normalization (OpenRefine), text analysis (Voyant), network analysis (Gephi), visualization (Raw, Palladio), and topic modeling (MALLET).</p>
            <p>Digital Émigré is committed not only to the exploration of the intellectual experience of diaspora cultural life. As a digital humanities project, it is itself invested in building intellectual communities around the engagement with this material and its afterlife. It aims to foster contact between scholars working with Russian and other Slavic languages internationally, especially through the discussion of issues of interoperability and creating multilingual digital research environments.</p>

Clark;Paul Dilley;Katherine Mary Faull;Rachel McBride-Lindsey;Peter Phillips,panel / roundtable,"Introduction
Scholarly discourse evaluating the digital turn in biblical and religious studies is at an early stage in its development, as attested to by the creation of two new

book series in 2016: Introduction to Digital Humanities: Religion (IDH, de Gruyter), and Digital Biblical Studies (DBS, Brill). Previously, Heidi Campbell published an overview of the topic (Campbell 2013), developed in further publications (Campbell-Althenho-fen 2015, Campbell-Garner 2016). In a recent overview, Carrie Schroeder develops two central questions on the topic: “what does it mean for Biblical Studies to be marginal to the Digital Humanities when DH is a field positioning itself as transformative for the humanities? How can our expertise in Biblical Studies influence and shape Digital Humanities for the better?” (Schroeder 2016). Using her field, Coptic studies, as an example she shows that the particular skills and needs of a marginal field within a marginal field can be a strong driver in DH.

Consequently, and for the first time at a DH meeting, this ninety-minute panel session asks what is the impact of the digital turn on religious studies and theology, and to what extent these somewhat marginal fields can bring something specific to the big DH tent. They particularly focus on textuality and on the symbolic impact of the “book” as attested to in the expression, “religions of the book,” coined in a programmatic lecture given in 1870 by F. Max Müller (2010). The symbolic, Western impact of books and writing was amplified by this notion, born at the time when the legal status of printed texts and authorship was completely secured in Western culture (Clivaz 2012).

For centuries, “books were perceived as a ‘wide angle' from which it was possible for everything to be observed, related to, and perhaps even decided” (Carrière-Eco 2009). The panel will consequently consider the hypothesis that the DH have been deeply influenced by this fascination with textuality and books during the first decades of their development; while keeping “the discourse of written texts” as a central pillar to the discussion according to the words of Roberto Busa, a foundational DH figure (Busa 2004). Busa's relationship to Biblical and religious materials has played a role in his approach to the computing field, as Jones point out (Jones 2016). The double impact of the book and the notion of “religions of the book”, successful in Western culture since the 19th century, provides an opening to understanding why DH in religious fields is still so focused on textuality. Indeed, when we collect examples of DH studies in diverse religious fields, we are unsurprisingly faced with very textual DH (Clivaz et al. 2016e). This observation

strengthens the necessity for religions in DH to consider the multimodal and multicultural turn provoked by digital culture.

With these different questions in mind, five panelists will participate in the presentations (sixty minutes in total) and a thirty-minute panel discussion that will be moderated by Claire Clivaz representing the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Vital-IT (Lausanne, CH). The following five speakers have agreed to participate and to discuss the general topic from the perspectives of their own research projects. In alphabetical order:

A Neophyte Proselytizes for Digital Humanities Pedagogy
Emily S. Clark
This presentation explores the ways in which Digital Humanities can enhance a Religious Studies classroom by focusing on two assignments that ask new questions of traditional course materials. The first is a project that was the culmination of a month's work collaboratively amongst a class of 25 students with a database platform (Omeka). This project entailed the digitization of archival photographs of a Native American community from 1916, along with the reading of Jesuit mission material (Clark et al. 2016). The second is an assignment that took two class periods and introduced students to data visualization (Voyant). This assignment introduced students to the differences between close reading and distant reading, along with

practicing both on excerpts from Jesuit mission documents (Mentrak - Bucko, 2016).

Topic Modeling the Bible
Paul Dilley
The talk will present the first full-scale topic model of the Bible and related literature in four different languages: Greek, Latin, Syriac and English. It will discuss both technical aspects of the process (e.g., the use or not of lemmatization; retention or removal of function words; optimal number of topics), as well as what we gain from comparing topic models of the same corpus translated into different languages. The presentation will focus on the interpretive gains and losses involved in topic modeling, one of the richest strategies of distant reading to the Bible which has been the subject of centuries of minute examination of the close reading tradition which Moretti has pointedly labeled a “theological exercise” (Moretti 2013).

Digital Lives: Reading Moravian Memoirs in the Age of the Internet
Katherine M. Faull
An international collaborative research project (USA, Sweden, Germany) is developing a digital platform for the investigation of the metadata and text of Moravian memoirs, composed since the mid-18th century by members of the Moravian Church to be read at their funeral (over 65,000 memoirs, housed in Germany and the US, Faull 1997). Less than 10% of the earliest manuscripts have been published. The developing digital interface (moravianlives.org) allows for geospatial and chronological visualization of author's birth and death place (Haskins 2007). This paper will investigate the intersection of the digital, the autobiographical, and the sacred in the age of the internet. How can the act of reading the lives of thousands of Moravians also be understood as an act of reconstituting the “invisible church” ? (van Dijk, 2007; Eakin 2014).

Material Religions in a Digital World
Rachel McBride-Lindsey
For much of the modern era, religion and theology have been intertwined in a decidedly material world. Over the last several decades, students of religion have begun to carve out intellectual headroom for an approach to material culture that recognizes objects and images as generative sources of theological inquiry and religious practice. Cultural institutions can be an effective tool for inviting researchers and the public into physical spaces and into contact with deeper dimensions of the material world. At the same time, these very contributions work against methodological gains in the study of material culture. Rachel McBride-Lindsay's presentation starts with this tension and draws from pedagogical attempts to incorporate digital platforms into projects anchored in the study of objects.

Exploring developmental patterns within Digital Theology Research within the Digital Humanities
Peter Phillips
Campbell and Altenhofen (2015) explore four waves in digital research development in theology and religion back into the late twentieth century. Their wave pattern picks up both historical and technological trends and patterns in research. However, a three wave theory dominates discussion within introductions to the Digital Humanities, discussed by David Berry (2011) and in the Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0. It tends to reflect modes of research, or groups of methodologies used in research rather than time periods. Reflecting on CODEC's own experience of Digital Theology in association with a range of other scholars, this paper will assess whether too many waves are a problem in our methodological theorizing.

LeBlanc,"paper, specified ""short paper""","Summary
Reproducing experimental results is a hallmark of empirical investigation and serves both to verify and inspire. This paper is a call for more systematic documentation of computational stylistic experiments. Publishing only summaries of the methods and results of empirical work is an artifact of traditional print media. To facilitate experimental reproducibility and to help the growing community who wish to learn how to apply computational methods and subsequently teach the next generation of scholars, the publication of results must include (i) access to the digitized texts, (ii) a clear workflow and most essentially (iii) the source code that led to each and all of the experimental results. By way of example, we present the steps and process in a GitHub repository for computationally probing the unknown and contested authorship of an 1831 short story entitled “A Dream” as we seek evidence if this work is similar to other attributed works by Edgar Allan Poe. The entire framework is intended as a pedagogical jumpstart for others, especially those new to computational stylometry. If Poe did write the story, it would be his first published work.

Introduction
As the Digital Humanities gains access to a wide array of digitized corpora and matures to a discipline that creatively defines new methods for computationally close and distant readings, a growing gap has emerged between those who apply sophisticated programming, e.g., Stylo In R (Eder et al., 2016) and those who are new to the game and need an introduction to the field. Typical of the community spirit in DH, significant efforts are underway to bridge this gap, including web-based tools for entry-level exploration including

Voyant Tools (Sinclair and Rockwell, 2016) and Lexos (Kleinman et al., 2016) and domain-specific introductions to programming, including Jockers' text (2014) and the Programming Historian (Crymble et al., 2016). This paper attempts to narrow the gap by encouraging both sides to document their experimental methods more fully to embrace previous calls for the replication of experimental methods (Rudman, 2012 et al.) and thereby teach effective practices by “leaving a trail” of experimental methods that enable others to execute and extend.

A Good Mystery: Towards Reproducibility
A GitHub repository or “repo” offers a workflow

that explores whether an 1831 story published under

the attribution of only ‘P' might have been written by Edgar Allan Poe. If so, it would be Poe's first published work. In addition to sharing a set of analytical methods applied in this experiment, the broader methodological-pedagogical goals are two-fold: (i) the dissemination of data and code should be championed as a cornerstone of DH research, thereby facilitating the replication of results and (ii) to share a workflow so that others may apply similar analyses to their texts of interest.

The workflow is stored as a set of numbered folders containing the texts and scripts (code) needed to complete each step. The workflow includes: collecting texts, the preprocessing, tokenization, and culling decisions made, unsupervised cluster analyses (k-means, hierarchical-agglomerative, bootstrap consensus tree), and supervised classification methods using Stylo in R's Delta, SVM, and NSC models. Each step represents scaffolding for a “teachable moment” with materials provided so faculty can more easily use them with students.

Scrubbing, Tokenization, Cutting, and
Culling
Lexos, a web-based, open-source workflow of tools (Kleinman, et al., 2016) was used to upload texts and “scrub” them by applying the following options: (i) convert words to lowercase, (ii) all punctuation was removed, (iii) however, a single word-internal hyphen and word-internal apostrophes were kept, and (iv) all digits were removed. Each individual word is considered as its own token. Larger stories were segmented (“cut”) into pieces. We experimented with various culling options, e.g., keeping only the most frequent words that appear in each text at least once.

Cluster Analysis
As a set of initial probes, we compared the contested story “A Dream” to (i) other stories attributed to Poe and (ii) mixed in with stories by other contemporaries. In the repo, we share four variations using cluster analysis:

1. K-means clustering on only Poe's stories (using Lexos)

2. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering on only Poe's stories (uses a Python sklearn module and a script to convert the cluster to ETE and Newick formats)

3. K-means clustering when all stories by each author are concatenated together (Lexos)

4. Bootstrap Consensus Tree (using Stylo in R).

The result from the Bootstrap Consensus Tree is shown in Figure 1. Of interest is that each author's stories cluster consistently together (with the exception that Bird's initial section of “Sheppard Lee” and his “Calavar” are found in different clades, at six and eight o'clock). “A Dream” clusters with the smaller Poe texts. As you'll see, we couldn't resist tossing in the four stories sometimes attributed to Edgar's brother Henry (“Monte Video”, “A Fragment”, “The Pirate”, and “Recollections”). These four stories are found within the cluster of Poe's known works (c.f. Collins, 2013).

A series of cluster analyses often serves well as a preliminary exploration, especially for scholars who are new to this game. Some of the file sizes are very small (e.g., one-half of the Poe stories in this corpus have fewer than 2000 words) and when strict culling is enforced (top-N words that appear at least once in each segment), the available set of words is reduced to only 38 when dealing with “A Dream” and the other eighteen Poe stories. That noted, these exploratory investigations shed some light on why some scholars consider that Poe's “first published tale may have been ‘A Dream'” (Silverman, 1991, p87).


Figure 1. Using Stylo in R Bootstrap Consensus Tree (BCT) showing “A Dream” consistently clustering with other Poe stories. The BCT aggregates results over multiple cluster analyses and shows those texts that satisfy a consensus number of the individual trials. Using 12 different authors

and at least two texts by each author for a total of 46 stories, Stylo formed clusters of the texts for the following frequency bands when using the most-frequent words: 100 to 1000 MFW.

Classification
Three classification models differentiated authorial writing style as implemented in Stylo in R. We scripted in R alongside Stylo to test “A Dream” over N-trials (N=10, 100) using a random selection of files for training sets in each trial. At least one text from each author is also included in the test set for each trial. A followup Python script parses the collected results to build confusion matrices for each author to provide metrics on how well the models predict each author's works. The most-frequently occurring, top-40 words (MFW, 1-grams) that appear in all the texts at least once were used.

Table 1: Attributions of the contested story “A Dream” over ten (10) trials with “A Dream” and another randomly selected Poe story in the test set in every trial. Confusion matrix values for results of testing Poe texts over all trials provide overall measures of model effectiveness. In the three cases

where “A Dream” was attributed to a different author, Poe was ranked second.

Summary
We offer a start to an exploration to collect evidence

as to whether Poe may have written the 1831 story “A

Dream” (c.f., Schoberlein (2016) who used the most frequent character 3-grams and attributed the story to Poe using Delta, but not so when using NSC nor SVM models). Evidence and methods aside, a GitHub repo provides a framework to share experimental workflows in a spirit similar to Jupyter notebooks, as well as one that facilitates both reproducible results and opportunities for subsequent contributions.

LeBlanc,poster / demo / art installation,"Lexos is a browser-based suite of tools that helps lower barriers of entry to computational text analysis for humanities scholars and students. Situated within a clean and simple interface, Lexos consolidates the common pre-processing operations needed for subsequent analysis, either with Lexos or with external tools. It is especially useful for scholars who wish to engage in research involving computational text analysis and/or wish to teach their students how to do so but lack the time for a manual preparation of texts, the skill sets needed to prepare their texts analysis, or the intellectual contexts for situating computational methods within their work. Lexos is also targeted at researchers studying early texts and texts in non-Western languages, which may involve specialized processing rules. It is thus designed to facilitate advanced research in these fields even for users more familiar with computational techniques. Lexos is developed by the Lexomics research group led by Michael Drout (Wheaton College), Mark LeBlanc (Wheaton College), and Scott Kleinman (California State University, Northridge). It is built on Python 2.7-Flask microframework, with jQuery-Bootstrap UI, and visualizations in d3.js. The Lexomics research group provides access to an public installation of Lexos which does not retain data after a session has expired. Users may also install Lexos locally by cloning the GitHub repository.

Lexos guides users through a workflow of steps that reflects effective practices when working with digitized texts. The workflow includes: (i) uploading Unicode-encoded texts in plain text, HTML, or XML formats; (ii) “scrubbing” functions for consolidating preprocessing decisions such as the handling of punctuation, white-space, and stop words, the use of lemmati-zation rules, and the handling of embedded markup tags and special character entities; (iii) “cutting” texts into segments based on the number of characters, tokens, or lines, or by embedded milestones such as chapter breaks; (iv) tokenization into a Document Term Matrix of raw or proportional counts using character or word n-grams; (v) visualizations such as comparative word clouds per segment (including the ability to visualize topic models generated by MALLET); Rolling Window Analysis that plots the frequency of string, phrase, or regular expression patterns or pattern-pair ratios over the course of a document or collection; and (vi) analysis tools including statistical summaries, hierarchical and k-means clustering, cosine similarity rankings, and Z-tests to identify the relative prominence of terms in documents, document classes, and the collection as whole. At each stage in the workflow the user may download data, visualizations, or the results of the analytical tools, along with metadata about their preprocessing decisions or the parameters selected for their experiments. Lexos thus enables the export of data for use with other tools and facilitates experimental reproducibility.

Figure 1: The Lexos Scrubber Tool

Lexos addresses three significant challenges for our intended users. The first challenge involves the adoption of computational text analysis methods. Many approaches require proficiency with command line scripting or the use of complex user interfaces that require time to master. Lexos addresses this problem through a simple, browser-based interface that manages workflow through the three major steps of text analysis: pre-processing, generation of statistical data, and visualization. In this, Lexos resembles Voyant Tools (Sinclair and Rockwell, 2016), although Lexos places more emphasis on and providing more tools for preprocessing and segmenting texts. Lexos also shares with tools like Stylometry with R (Eder, et al., 2013; Eder, 2013) and emphasis on cluster analysis, providing both hierarchical and K-Means clustering with silhouette scores as limited form of statistical validation. While Lexos is not a topic modeling tool, it provides a useful “topic cloud” feature for MALLET data that will be useful for beginners since there are few accessible ways to visualize MALLET output that work well out of the box.


Figure 2: The Lexos Multicloud tool showing Chinese ""topic clouds""

The second challenge is the opacity of the procedures required to move between computational and traditional forms of text analysis. In order to reduce the “black boxiness” of algorithmic methods, Lexos contains an embedded component called “In the Margins” which provides non-technical explanations of the statistical methods used and effective practices for

handling situations typical of humanities data. “In the

Margins” is a Scalar “book” which can be read separately; however, its individual pages are embedded in Lexos using Scalar's API, making them easily accessible for users of the tool. Lexos shares with tools like Voyant an engagement with the hermeneutics of text analysis and attempts to embed “In the Margins” discussion of these issues in the user interface close to the user's workflow. We hope “In the Margins” will host advice and commentary from contributors with the Digital Humanities community.

A third challenge is the tension between quantitative and computational approaches and the traditions of theoretical and cultural criticism that dominate the humanities in the academy. As Alan Liu (2013) has recently argued, the challenge is to give a better theoretical grounding to the hybrid quantitative-qualitative method of the Digital Humanities by exploring the ways in which we negotiate the difficulties imposed by “the aporia between tabula rasa quantitative interpretation and humanly meaningful qualitative interpretation” (414). The design of Lexos and the discussions in “In the Margins” are intended to open a space for discussion of issues related to the opacity of algorithmic approaches and the limitations and epistemological challenges of computational stylistic analysis and visual representation of humanities data.

This poster presentation provides demonstrations of Lexos using some literature from Old, Middle, and Modern English, as well Chinese, which are in our current test suite. We also discuss use cases and best practices, how to install Lexos locally, and how scholars may contribute to the still growing content of “In the Margins”.

Visualization techniques developed in the sciences normally focus on the (re)presentation of empirical data. But how can we graphically express interpretations? This paper presents the intellectual framework

underpinning the 3DH project (Three-dimensional Visualizations for the Digital Humanities), a collaborative project conducted at the University of Hamburg from 2016 to 2019. The project foregrounds data interpretation and develops a visualization paradigm from the epistemological perspective of the humanities. The “third dimension” required in DH visualization techniques is therefore not merely that of an additional quantitative z-axis. Rather, it is an axis that can ‘unflatten' (Sousanis 2015) the objectivist notion of visualized data. In our presentation, we will do three things:

•    Digital and visual turn: Review existing visualization paradigms that emphasize the representational approach. We start with the epistemological issues raised by the digital and visual turn.

•    Visual modelling: Outline and discuss an interpretative modelling alternative through two case studies of existing tools, CATMA and Voyant, and Temporal Modelling, a platform for creating data through graphical means.

• “Hermeneuticizing” visualization: Discuss the design of a full visual framework. We will present possible conventions and prototypes that use them. These inform our case studies and the envisaged infrastructure.

Case studies in our presentation will be drawn from CATMA (a collaborative mark-up & text analysis environment), Voyant (a text analysis platform), and humanities research projects using base images (historical maps) and original models (for non-standard chronologies).

The digital and the visual turn: a hermeneutic ceterum censeo

For centuries, academic discourse in humanities disciplines has relied predominantly on text. In DH, however, visualizations increasingly claim the status of arguments and proofs that play a decisive role in the development and presentation of ideas, findings, and conclusions.

The visual and the digital turn have thus gone hand in hand - but the way in which this synergy manifests itself remains constrained in a symptomatic way. We can print a chart or render it on screen just as we can print or display a text in various media, but we normally cannot subject the chart to in-depth critique in the way we can question and respond to the text. Inadvertently, once generated and communicated as ‘output', visualizations seem to take on a quasi-dogmatic quality - they are hard to deconstruct, let alone reconfigure; they state their case but seem removed from critical reflection.

Most current DH visualizations are thus epistemological one-way avenues toward knowledge, from data via rendering algorithm to visual display. Charts, graphs, interactive maps, timelines, and similar representations are by and large imports from the natural and social sciences (Friendly 2008). Many of them emanate from domains of empirical research that conceptualize knowledge production as a function of empirical observation and objective measurement followed by analysis, inference, and conclusion. These approaches to visualization, however, hide two critical aspects, namely

(a) the underlying human modeling of the represented phenomena as data, which is already an interpretive and meaning-creating act that often oscillates repeatedly between observation and interpretation (Kitchin 2014), and

(b) the meaning-lessness of certain visual effects that are owed to contingent technological constraints (screen size, rendering, scaling, choice of color, etc.).

DH is in a unique position to investigate the domains of human experience and of its expression in symbolic practices and artefacts from two complementary methodological vantage points: the numeric, which models them as statistical phenomena, and the hermeneutic, which explores them as phenomena of meaning and thus by definition as a function of interpretation (Rockwell & Sinclair 2016). Where meaning comes into focus, our theories, object models, and practices

must therefore be conceptually aligned and ‘herme-

neuticized' - just as numeric approaches come with the pre-requisite of quantification. Against this backdrop, we propose to reintroduce the dimension of interpretation into visualization: Methodological principles of hermeneutic approaches, such as multi-per-spectivity, subjectivity, and context-boundedness present a challenge which representational visualization cannot and which interpretational visualization must meet.

Two questions arise: What are the defining principles of a genuinely humanistic and hermeneutically oriented approach to visualization? And how can we graphically express and support interpretation in DH visualizations - both as an activity and as a product of humanistic enquiry?

Visual modeling of interpretation vs. visualization of data

In the 3DH project, we address the former question by conceptual analysis and critique of existing approaches to visualization in DH, and then by systematically specifying and developing a visualization environment that can support higher level data interpretation rather than base-level data representation. In the presentation, we will share our survey of existing tools and their affordances but focus on two tools that we have developed, CATMA and Voyant.


Figure 1: Visualization of interpretive text annotation in CATMA

Our premise is that interpretation happens through the deliberate activity of an individual engaging with an image, text, display, or other artifact to create an argument about its meaning and a way it should be read.

For example, in CATMA (Figure 1) such an activity - in this instance the interpretive act of text annotation - is executed and represented by (a) highlighting a string on screen, (b) assigning it a tag, and (c) storing the annotation in a stand-off markup file. However, the annotation is at the same time (d) visually expressed as colored underlining. Moreover, via its visual representation on screen - the colored underlining - the markup data can also be (e) inspected, analyzed, manipulated directly, and even (f) enriched with meta-annotation. This is but one example of interpretative modeling.

Current representational ‘one-way' techniques like topic modeling (see Figure 2) are seen as a way to deal with scale, they process large amounts of data into summary abstractions called topics that can be displayed as lists or in other ways (Montague et. al 2015). In our second case study, we will therefore show how we are adapting scale tools to create a prototypical bidirectional 3DH visual modeling environment for big



Figure 2: Galaxy Viewer

data. We believe visual modeling can support not only interpretative close reading of primary data but also the reading of large collections like the collections of the Hathi Trust.

‘Hermeneuticizing' base-level visualization through activators: the 3DH framework of interpretive parameters and dimensions

A key goal of the 3DH project is to develop a set of generic graphic features that can be used to create interpretative attributes and/or inflections of visual representations of data, alter underlying data structures, and activate three-dimensional space in the service of interpretative activity. These features which aim to ‘hermeneuticize' visualizations are termed activators. In the presentation we will show the framework of the

activator set that was developed during a series of cha-

rettes (design workshops) in 2016.


Figure 3: Framework of Concept Modeling workspace: Shows features, activators, and dimensions from various pictorial conventions.

The visual activators in our feature set are not simply graphical marks or animations on a screen display: They perform data structuring functions and as such provide a conceptual framework for ‘hermeneu-ticizing' existing base-level data visualization techniques (see Fig.3). The individual features of this framework indicate and facilitate interpretative moves made by the user, such as a qualification of visualized data structures in terms of salience, irrelevance, uncertainty, degree of completeness, and other attributes or inflections. For example, uncertainty can be expressed by overlaying a standard graph with visual effects such as blur or shading, whereas the introduction of additional interpretative dimensions, such as point of view systems, parallax, relative scales, and other conventions from the visual arts, will support higher levels of interpretative critique and reflection, such as explicitly marking the historicity and context-dependency of underlying data.

Conclusion

As Pinker (1990) argues, the ease with which a particular graph can be understood is a function of the processing effort that goes into the exercise: The more we can rely on ‘hard-wired' encoding connections between the visual and the conceptual and the more we are guided by established graph and comprehension schemata (such as Gestalt phenomena), the less ‘intelligent' effort we have to put into reading a graph. Yet in a humanities perspective such conventionalized ‘ease of comprehension' is a double-edged sword: It may optimize the process of (re)cognition - but it also progressively obscures the constructedness of a visualization, turning it into an apparently self-evident object of perception. The 3DH project counters this anti-hermeneutic tendency toward reification by moving from a conceptualization of the principles of visualization as interpretative modeling to the development of a visual language framework, and finally the instantiation of the principles and language in two case studies. In terms of implementation, this approach is supported by drawing on Bertin's Semiology of Graphics and the high-level object-oriented Grammar of Graphics approach outlined by Wilkinson (2005), and features from game engines, three-dimensional modelling, and other pictorial conventions (Panofsky (1991) and Burgin (1991)).

To conclude, we will discuss next steps toward developing a 3DH environment that can act as a generic, project independent infrastructure for introducing user parameterized enunciative functionality into graphical displays. This infrastructure will make it possible to inscribe into visualizations the critical features of authorship, speaking/spoken subject, and an epistemological perspective grounded in situated and constructed approaches to knowledge. These interpretative principles are well mapped in, e.g., critical theory, narratology, visual studies, and cultural studies, but they have not been integrated into a graphical environment for hermeneutic practice yet: the methodological lacuna which the 3DH project tries to address.

Voces (from Lat. vox 'voice', 'word') is an analysis

and visualisation dashboard for corpus-based research in lexical semantics. Currently developed as a Shiny application communicating with R session running in the background, Voces provides users with possibly exhaustive account of how selected Latin word is distributed across the corpus and what can be told about its meaning. The application is built around a corpus which currently consists of ca. 200M words from texts dating from the Classical era (1 BCE) to the Middle Ages (14th CE). Although Voces was originally conceived as a tool of historical semantics research, the application - due to its modular design - may be modified and the code basis can be re-used in new research contexts.

Lexical Semantics with R


Information computed on a basis of a CWB-indexed corpus is presented to a user through a single-page interface composed of separate widgets arranged in a clear grid layout. Each widget is responsible for displaying in textual or graphical form a clear-cut property of word's distribution or meaning. A heavy use of data visualisation techniques renders Voces a convenient tool for exploratory analysis of textual corpora, but the grid layout is also reflection of modular architecture of the application. Each widget is implemented as a separate function which can be extended and adopted by researchers with even limited R programming skills.

Use scenarios
A typical use scenario is triggered when the user specifies a lemma to be looked up. If the search fails, a list of lemmas to choose from is provided. In case of success, neatly separated sections of the dashboard are populated with widgets, each of which corresponds to one sense or distributional property of the word under scrutiny.


Fig. 2: Voces. User Interface: Frequency Spectrum Plot (Voces. User Interface (tempus 'time')

Word's frequency is summarised as a number of occurrences in the corpus (both raw and p.m.w. counts) and displayed as a highlighted point on a frequency spectrum plot (Baayen 2001). A barplot is provided for investigating change of frequency in subsequent corpus sections. Study of language variation is enabled through widgets presenting word's frequency as a function of such variables as author, work, genre, and - most importantly - time. Users are, therefore, provided with a list of authors who use the word most frequently or a word cloud summarising terms to be found in the titles of works with a particularly frequent use of the word under scrutiny. Genre variation is presented in form of a pie chart, while diachronic dimension - through a bar plot of frequency counts in partitions of the corpus. Diatopic variation study is still to be implemented.

A word's meaning potential can be investigated by means of a set of widgets presenting its contextual properties. The most frequent co-occurrences are enumerated on a simple count list which may be further analysed according to period and genre criteria. A Distributional Semantics Model (Baroni and Lenci 2010) is built from the corpus in order to enable simple meaning computation. Evert's (2014) wordspace package and a set of Alain Guerreau's scripts is employed in order to cluster co-occurrences. Similar terms of a looked up word are also computed and then presented in both textual and graphical form.

Users are supported in data and visualisation interpretation through hints which accompany every widget. Their role is to explain not only what the data can mean, but also how the figures were computed, how one can interpret the geometrical properties of a plot, and so on. This, along with the availability of data sets, code snippets, and reports generated on the fly, is what makes Voces a tool of reproductive research.

Architecture
Voces was built as a Shiny application (Chang et al. 2016). Its development was greatly facilitated by the availability of a decent documentation and community support (both particularly useful when dealing with framework's complex reactivity model). It turned out soon, however, that it may not be the best choice for web application which has to combine heterogeneous data and non-R code as well. Hence, other solutions are being tested at the moment, those in particular which would provide, for example, more flexible integration of external APIs. The most promising seems to be OpenCPU (Ooms 2014), an application which exposes R session through a RESTful API. This approach allows any application written in some of the less or more popular web development frameworks to easily communicate with an R server instance.

As for the architecture, Voces depends on a CQP server instance running in the background which requires corpora to be indexed with the CWB. Communication of the R server with the CWB is assured through the rcqp package (Desgraupes and Loiseau 2012) which offers a set of useful functions providing access to both positional (token-level) and structural (document-level) attributes. Unfortunately, development of this very helpful tool seems to be less active recently and thus Voces will soon accept also tabular data as input.

Previous research
Nowadays, corpus linguists may chose from a vast array of free, open source and stable corpus query systems (CQS) which not only allow for efficient indexing of large corpora, but also provide a user-friendly concordance interface and offer out-of-the-box a set of such essential functionalities as collocation lists, simple corpus statistics etc. Both web (CQPweb, NoSketchEngine etc.) and desktop applications (TXM etc.) are also usually equipped with a less or more intuitive corpus management interface. Voces, a dashboard for vocabulary research, is not yet another CQS and has no intention to supersede well-established tools which cannot be easily combated in terms of either robustness or speed. Quite the contrary, the application communicates with the CWB engine and adapts some of the design choices and features of the popular CQS, while hopefully does not inherit their drawbacks.

Unlike the case of the well-known CQS, more emphasis has been put on quick access to multifaceted information rather than on close analysis of occurrences. Voces does not attempt, then, to implement some of the features which are traditionally considered an important part of the corpus analytical toolbox, such as concordance sampling, sorting etc. Undoubtedly, the strength of popular CQS lies in their wide applicability: by default, they do not preclude any research scenario. Although agnostic of linguistic theory, Voces was originally built for more specific purposes and focuses on semantic properties of the word and its distribution.

What is believed to be one of the main advantages of the present application is that - thanks to its modular architecture - it can be easily extended or adopted by a researcher with even moderate programming skills. In that Voces attempts to fill the gap that exists between, on the one hand, fully-blown CQS, which are normally quite conservative when it comes to adding

new features, and, on the other hand, single-purpose

research workflows built ad hoc by researchers. What also distinguishes Voces from other CQS is its emphasis on helping users to interpret data. A system of visual and textual hints keeps a researcher informed about where does the data come from, how have they been computed etc.

The grid layout is well-known from analytical environment and is especially popular in finances or engineering (Few 2013); in humanities it was adopted, among others, in the Voyant Tools project. It offers a quick insight into otherwise dispersed data and a coherent account of word's properties.

Further research
Voces is currently in an early stage of development. The work focuses on adding new functionalities and plotting types which may sometimes affect application's efficiency. Future work will focus on: (1) optimising user experience; (2) implementing tools for (a)

comparative (ie. two-lemma) research and (b) tracking language change; (3) better processing user input (multi-word search).

Pedagogy in the Digital Humanities is now leaving its “bracketed” state - a term used by HIRSCH 2012 to emphasise the fact that this dimension was not given the consideration its practical importance deserves. As programmes and courses are created on a larger scale and increasingly drive institutional strategies, also in Europe (see Sahle, 2013 and the DARIAH Digital Humanities Course Registry), it becomes essential to make comparisons and shared reflections possible.

Since 2014 all students of Greek and Latin languages and literatures at the Université Paris-Ouest Nanterre (France) have been enrolling in a Master programme entitled “Humanités classiques et humani-tés numériques.” Each semester features a fully fledged course of Digital Humanities: it is therefore an experiment in embedding Digital Humanities into an existing discipline, or rather into the array of disciplines which constitute the field of Classical studies around its philological backbone.

The aim of this poster is to share the approach I take in designing and teaching these courses, and to reflect on what this experience suggests about digital educational models, in Classics and beyond.

The poster will have three components, devoted to situating, describing and comparing the courses. Context and History

I will set out the conditions in which the curriculum was reformed (which involves both national and local contexts), the specific problems encountered (as the heterogeneous levels and motivations of the students, the relationships with the other courses, the available technical options, or the recent introduction of podcasting and distance learning), as well as the rationale and methods which shape the courses, including its main sources of inspiration in the Digital

Humanities community, whether online syllabi or publications like Jockers (2014) and Rockwell and Sinclair (2016).

Overview of the Courses

The courses alternately take the form of more traditional classes and collaborative or personal projects. Across the two years, their contents include theoretical and historical insights, while concentrating on hands-on experience: digital literacy elements are gradually integrated as students go from traditional scholarly editing recreated in Markdown and HTML to critical editing in TEI XML (the focus of year 1) and, beyond text and editing, discover computer-assisted analytical and visualisation methods with the Voyant Tools software environment and then work in a literate programming framework (For which the canonical reference is Knuth, 1984) implemented in R Markdown (the focus of year 2, see Figure 1).


Figure 1: Text analysis in RStudio

The principles of the courses will be expounded: favouring active participation, learning-by-doing and flipped classroom teaching; insisting on the critical, reflexive dimension of digital procedures; promoting free resources like TEI by Example (Van den Branden, Terras, and Vanhoutte) and The Programming Historian (Crymble et al), as well as data reuse; developing an open publication culture through the Classiques et numériques blog maintained by the students (see Figure 2) or a shared Zotero group library; creating an awareness of the surrounding Digital Humanities communities; fostering actual collaboration, both between the students and with other projects or programmes - to date, with another MA specialised in Web design on an online edition prototype, with the Pelagios Commons project on the annotation of place names and with the Sunoikisis

Digital Classics network in its effort to collectively define a core syllabus.

Comparing Models

Finally, drawing on this experience I will address several aspects of the current development of Di-gital Humanities pedagogy: as a separate entreprise or within established disciplines, with or without infrastructural, collegial or cross-departmental support, in various time formats, with different modes of external collaboration, etc. To sketch this broader typology, I will compare this French series of courses with other models, using in particular the data contributed to the aforementioned Digital Humanities Course Registry.

The poster will be in English, but I will naturally interact with the audience of the poster sessions both in English and French.

Teaching students the techniques of distant reading can be challenging as it depends on re-framing the familiar object of study. But another difficulty altogether is that this approach depends on a digitized corpus; and such a corpus, in turn, depends on someone, somewhere doing the difficult labor of digitization. One might ask, then: if “teaching digital humanities” means “teaching distant reading,” shouldn’t it also mean “teaching digitization”?

In this paper, I will discuss a collaborative, multiyear assignment that I conducted in two of my “Introduction to Digital Humanities” courses at Emory University: the digitization and analysis of the complete works of Ernest Hemingway (Croxall). With the goal of teaching my students not only how to do distant reading but also about the intense labor that goes into corpus preparation, we digitized the whole of Hemingway’s work in just two weeks. Working from newly purchased copies of the texts, the students and I rapidly scanned hundreds of pages, performed and corrected optical character recognition, and assembled a corpus—with each of us spending no more than 4 hours on the task. Our from-scratch corpus was composed expressly so we could draw important distinctions among Hemingway’s works: individual works vs the whole collection; fiction vs non-fiction; and works published before while Hemingway was alive vs those that appeared after his death in 1961. I will detail what we learned from rapid digitization and how those lessons affected the second iteration of the assignment.

After preparing the corpus, students worked in groups to analyze the many works of Hemingway that they had not had time to read. Making use of Voyant Tools, they identified themes in the corpus and charted patterns that could never have been observed through regular, close reading methods. For example, the class confirmed that while Hemingway insists on writing about “men,” the women to whom they are attached are inevitably just “girls.” In an attempt to chart the patterns of Hemingway’s diction, another group of students investigated the terms he uses to introduce dialogue. Unsurprisingly, the students discovered that “said” is by far the most frequent such term across the entire corpus. What was more surprising, however, was to observe that in late and posthumous writings, the frequency of “said” suddenly drops by 50%. In short, by building our own corpus from scratch, the students were able to conduct original research, something that is relatively rare for many undergraduates in humanities programs.

Building our collection of texts from scratch had two critical advantages. First, we were able to create a small, relatively clean corpus whose provenance we knew. This provided a sense of confidence in the data as we began to distant read. Furthermore, while our analysis of Hemingway’s works was “distant” compared to traditional close reading of a single novel or story, it was not nearly as distant as projects that deal with several thousand texts. We became engaged, in short, in close-distant reading. Second, digitizing the texts ourselves allowed us to skirt a problem that frequently plagues distant reading texts from the twentieth century: copyright. As an educational endeavor focused on teaching the students how to prepare their research materials, this guerilla digitization project fell under the regime of fair use in the United States.

To close, I will discuss how students at Brown University and I have taken further steps with the Hemingway corpus and with their digital humanities education as we have used it as a means to explore the methods and utility of topic modeling. Topic modeling is frequently deployed to come to terms with large and unwieldy corpora (see Jockers; Nelson; Nelson, Mimno, and Brown; Underwood and Goldstone). But working with a small, relatively clean corpus that is created from scratch allows students to better understand what takes place via unsupervised machine learning. At the same time, topic modeling allows us to ask in a new way some of the same questions that my former students had already uncovered: how does Hemingway’s dialog differ from his prose? how different are the topics in Hemingway’s fiction from those of his non-fiction? to what degree does his late—or even posthumous—work differ from what he wrote three decades earlier?

In the end, the process of modeling Hemingway becomes a means by which we can model all of digital humanities—both analysis and corpus creation—in a student-focused environment (see also Brier; Croxall and Singer; Harris; Hirsch; Jewell and Lorang; and Swafford). By doing digital humanities from scratch, students can be engaged in original research and see for themselves, from start to finish, how digital humanities gets done.

We have chosen to bootstrap in R, a high level and high productivity language, with methods that are open, repeatable, and sustainable. The aim is to provide code templates that can be adapted, remixed, and scaled to fit a wide range of text analysis tasks. This poster presents our approach to teaching computational text analysis and a representative hypothetical case study in which two different users are able to start with the same corpus and adapt code to achieve very different end results in a way not currently possible with black box tools.

This paradigm is fundamentally different from that currently practiced by many in the digital humanities. Black-boxed tools with GUIs that hide computation are very popular for introducing new practitioners of text analysis in the digital humanities to basic algorithms and outputs. In 2012, AntConc was downloaded 120,000 times by users in 80 different countries (Anthony, 2014). Voyant 1.0 had 113 sites linking to it actively in 2012 (Sinclair and Rockwell, 2013) and the week Voyant 2.0 was released the server went down multiple times from excess traffic (@VoyantTools, 2016). However, one of its default corpora is the Shakespearean dramas, with speaker names and stage directions. ((Sinclair and Rockwell, 2016). The inclusion of speaker names skews all algorithms related to frequency counts of characters (e.g. word clouds), which a new user may not even think to take into account. Using AntConc's concordance tool with a Shakespearean corpora including speaker names gives an idea of when a character speaks and when a character is mentioned, but this conflation might not jump out at a new user. If anything, we suggest learning about algorithms first and then moving up to black-box tools when one has the means to critique them.

Having looked at popular “plug-and-play” tools for corpora visualization, it becomes evident that even simple visualizations can lead to inaccurate results if the user is not thinking through how a corpus is being processed to produce a result. We believe that if the user understands how the algorithm is generating visualizations, they can contribute more meaningfully to critiques of sophisticated algorithms when partnered with programmers or even go on to bootstrap themselves with awareness of their domain's particular caveats. Thus, we advocate teaching humanists the basics of coding to create conversant programmers similar to the methodology behind Matthew Jockers' Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature, but with a slightly slower ramp up. To this end we have a three-step process of introducing R: web-deployed Shiny apps, highly marked up RNotebooks, and lightly commented RScripts, both in “regular” and higher performance versions. All are available for download on Github (with associated sample data from Shakespeare and Twitter) (CyberDH Team, 2017). We hope that this simpler bootstrapping method that mixes code and explanation, pedagogy and self-driven inquiry, will be of use to those looking to onramp new practitioners who may go on to partner with programmers if needed or to remix available code to look at their own knowledge domain.

In Hermeneutica, Geoffrey Rockwell and Stéfan Sinclair (2016) argue for an approach to the digital humanities that deemphasizes the tool and positivist notions of proof. Their proposed approach, also called Hermeneutica, champions tool accessibility over tool sophistication. Similarly, scholarly play is legitimated as a useful step in developing research questions and as a means to reconsider established notions within literary disciplines. The aim of Hermeneutica as a methodology seems to be the generation of interesting humanistic questions as much as the resolution of open questions.

Rockwell and Sinclair demonstrate the difference between Hermeneutica and typical DH approaches by quoting from Gary Wong's 2009 blog post:

[Typical DH] takes the worst part of the scientific papers (really really long sets of tabular data in the body of the text) and the worst part of papers from the humanities (really really complicated language where simple language would have done) and puts it in one. If this is what the cooperation of computational text analysis and traditional literary analysis yield, I

am scared.

Because Hermeneutica attempts to join the best parts of these fields, it has the potential to turn DH into a discipline that is more useful for the vast majority of non-DH humanists. It could be the means of accelerating the mainstreaming of DH methods and bringing us to the eventual point where all humanities are digital—a destination Claire Clivaz described succinctly (DARIAH, 2016).

Voyant
One feature that distinguishes Hermeneutica from many other DH approaches is its companion set of tools meant to demonstrate its application. Voyant Tools, now referred to simply as Voyant, is a web-based, modular suite of tools meant to be “worth thinking with” (Rockwell and Sinclair, 2016: 10, original emphasis). The goal is to accommodate playful exploration of text and sharing of corpora across the web. It is not designed as an industrial-grade text analysis tool, but as a “toy” that allows scholars to uncover new questions and gain new appreciation of texts.

Current limitations of Hermeneutica
A fundamental component of Hermeneutica is that the scholar views text through the lens of Voyant (or other computational text analysis tools), and then synthesizes that experience with their prior knowledge of the text and its milieu. A problem that Voyant addresses, but does not solve, is that many scholars who know the most about specific texts lack the technological skills that would be considered pre-novice in DH circles. Voyant allows everyone with a text and a browser to explore word frequencies, collocations, etc., but it presupposes that the text is available and clean enough for use. In order for Hermeneutica to appeal to non-DH humanities scholars, these issues of text availability and the lack of user skill must first be addressed.

On the issue of text availability, it is not often that scholars wish to analyze text that is rare or missing. More often they are interested in text that is protected by various copyright laws, which prohibit posting the text to public websites such as Voyant. Thankfully, in the Unites States at least, Google Books' recent court victory (Stohr, 2016) now permits scholars to publish online the analysis results derived from copyrighted texts, so long as the original text is not recoverable by the user. To this end Rockwell and Sinclair developed Voyant 2's “non-consumptive” mode which restricts access to tools that allow full-text views.

While such developments represent Rockwell and Sinclair's amenability to meet the ever-evolving needs of Hermeneuticans, accommodating users' lack of technology skill is beyond the scope of their involvement. For example, it is not reasonable to expect the Voyant developers to be concerned over issues of text acquisition or text preparation. Rather, those con-cerns—while critical to expanding the pool of potential Hermeneuticans—are issues of local implementation. Similarly, it makes sense that Voyant would offer the ability to link to a corpus after uploading the text, but uploading the text and keeping track of various versions of corpora is beyond the scope of Voyant. A local practice of adding some structure around the

Voyant suite ought to make Hermeneutica useful to a far greater audience than it is now.

Scaffolding
In the field of instructional design, such structure is called scaffolding. Specifically, scaffolding refers to the process of providing learners adequate introduction and examples before allowing them to attempt a task on their own (Bruner, 1978). For scaffolded Her-meneutica, DH-savvy professionals can work to acquire, clean, and upload text to Voyant (and other tools), and then provide public listings of the resulting corpora.

Examples of scaffolded Hermeneutica
We have implemented this scaffolded Hermeneu-tica approach in our Office of Digital Humanities beginning with the Cormac McCarthy Corpus Project (CMCP). The CMCP includes 13 Voyant corpora of McCarthy's 10 novels: one for the complete works, one for each novel, and two for novels (The Orchard Keeper and The Road) where the narration has been segregated from the dialogue. But the linchpin of scaffolded Hermeneutica is the CMCP's publicly-accessible website that organizes these Voyant corpora. The website is built on WordPress with the Pods content management plugin, and contains information on McCarthy's work, descriptions of Voyant (and other tools), and listings of links to the Voyant corpora. An essential feature of the website's structure is the ability to accommodate revisions to the current corpora as well as the addition of other tools in the future. Already, there is a non-Voyant sentence structure search tool attached as a beta-testing option.

A rough version of the Cormac McCarthy Corpus Project was presented at the 2015 conference of the Cormac McCarthy Society. The reaction to these tools being available for public use was strongly positive. One attendee referred to the website as “a game-changer.”

The same scaffolded Hermeneutica is being implemented on two other projects: Machado a longa distancia and The Modernist Short Fiction Project. Preliminary demonstrations of the approach have yielded similar reactions to what we observed with the CMCP. Non-DH scholars become excited rather than anxious when the digital analysis tools are scaffolded to provide them ready access. In fact, these demonstrations turn into play sessions where non-DH scholars repeatedly request for certain words to be added to the frequency charts and other Voyant panels.

Hermeneutica and Voyant represent the greatest potential for growth in DH not because they are the most technologically or theoretically advanced developments, but because they are the most accessible to non-DH scholars. Still, they don't quite reach the ground level of technology skills possessed by most researchers in the humanities. The scaffolded Herme-neutica approach proposed in this paper seems to span that gap to make Hermeneutica more accessible.

            <p>Rationale </p>
            <p>Twitter data can be very valuable for researchers of perhaps all disciplines, not just DH. Given the difficulties to properly collect and analyse Twitter data as viewable from most Twitter Web and mobile clients (as most people use Twitter) and the very limited short - span of search results, there is the danger of losing huge amounts of valuable historical material. </p>
            <p>Tweets are like butterflies – one can only really look at them for long if one pins them down out of their natural environment. The reason why we have access to Twitter in any form is because of Twitter’s API, which stands for Application Programming Interface. Free access to historic Twitter search results is limited to the last 7 days. This is due to several reasons, including the incredible amount of data that is requested from Twitter’s API, and – this is an educated guess – not disconnected from the fact that Twitter’s business model relies on its data being a commodity that can be resold for research. Twitter’s data is stored and managed by Twitter’s enterprise API platform. </p>
            <p>For the researcher interested in researching Twitter data, this means that harvesting needs to be do ne not only through automated means but in real time. It also puts scholars without the required coding and data mining skills at a disadvantage. As a researcher, this basically means that there is no way to do proper research of Twitter data without understanding how it works at API level, and this means understanding the limitations and possibilities this imposes on researchers. </p>
            <p>What’s a n individual researcher without access to pay corporate access to do? The whole butterfly colony cannot be captured with the nets most of us have available. At small scale, however, and collecting in a timely fashion, it is still possible to capture interesting and more - or - less complete specimens using fairly simply, non - coding required methods. (The Library of Congress h s now 12 years’ worth of text - only Tweets. However, as before, the Library of Congress Twitter collection will remain embargoed and there was no projected timetable for providing public access as of 26 December 2017). </p>
            <p>Most researchers out there are likely not to benefit from access to huge Twitter data dumps. For researchers without much resources that are trying to do the talk whilst doing the walk, and conduct research

            <p>Abstract</p>
            <p>We present LitViz, a webbased tool for visualizing literary data which utilizes the text2voronoi algorithm to map natural language texts onto voronoi diagrams. These diagrams can be used, for example, to visually differentiate between (groups of) authors. Text2voronoi utilizes the paradigm of text visualization to reconstruct text classification (e.g., authorship attribution) as a task of image classification. This means that, in contrast to conventional approaches to text classifiction, we do not directly use linguistic features, but explore visual features derived from the texts' visualizations to perform operations on texts. We illustrate LitViz by means of 18 authors, each of whom is represented by 5 literary works.</p>
            <p>Introduction</p>
            <p>In this paper we present a new tool, called LitViz, for the visual depiction of literary works. To this end, we utilize the text2voronoi algorithm (see Mehler et al. (2016b)) which maps natural language texts to image representations. The idea is to generate images of texts which can be used instead of these texts’ symbolic information to characterize them, for example, in terms of authorship, topic or genre. Text2voronoi is in line with the paradigm of text visualization to reconstruct text classification (e.g., authorship attribution) as a task of image classification. In contrast to conventional approaches to text classification, we therefore do not directly use linguistic features, but explore visual features derived from the texts’ visualizations in order to identify, for example, their authors. We exemplify LitViz by means of 18 authors each of whom is represent by 5 literary works. LitViz allows for interacting with the visualizations of these works in two modes: two- and three-dimensionally (see Figure 1 and 2).</p>

            <p>Related Work</p>
            <p>The idea of visualizing literature was inspired by Martin Wattenberg’s The Shape of Song1 (Wattenberg, 2001; Wattenberg, 2002). Wattenberg explores identical or otherwise repetitive passages of a composition to visually depict them. This is done by means of semicircles, which combine repeated and repetitive positions in such a way that the micro- and macro-structure of a composition becomes visible. Our idea is to transpose this idea to the visualization of literary data. </p>
            <p>Kucher and Kerren (2015) give an overview of state-of-theart techniques of text visualization and present a website that allows for differentiating between these techniques. Cao and Cui (2016) provide a systematic review of many advanced visualization techniques and discuss the fundamental notion of information visualization. </p>
            <p>Mehler et al. (2016a) present a web tool called Wikidition which allows for automatically generating large-scale editions of text corpora. This is done by using multiple text mining tools for automatically linking lexical, sentential and textual data. The output is stored and visualized using a MediaWiki. Thus, any Wikidition is extensible by its readers based on the wiki principle. </p>
            <p>Rockwell and Sinclair (2016) present a detailed web tool, called Voyant tools, for visualizing texts. Unlike Voyant, our focus is on non-standard techniques of visualizing textual data that go beyond histograms, scatterplots, line charts and related tools. </p>
            <p>Generally speaking, text visualization supports distant reading as introduced and exemplified by Moretti (2013), Rule et al. (2015) and Michel et al. (2011). These approaches show how visualizations that support distant reading may look like to get overviews of documents by just looking at the final visualizations. LitViz is a tool following this tradition: it utilizes text2voronoi to extend the set of techniques mapping textual data. In this way, it combines Wattenberg’s approach with distant reading techniques from the point of view of text visualization.

            <p>Model</p>
            <p>Our goal is to generate images from literary works in a way that text classifiers can be fed by the features of these iconic representations in order to perform classification experiments, for which usually linguistic features are explored. This is the task of the text2voronoi algorithm, which calculates image representations of texts in four steps Mehler et al. (2016b): In the first step, the input text is analyzed by means of TextImager Hemati et al. (2016) to extract linguistic features in the usual way, that is, features, spanning a vector space of linguistic data. In the second step, the resulting vector space is used to compute embeddings for each of the extracted linguistic features. Embeddings are produced by means of word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013). In the third step, a voronoi tessellation of the embedded features is computed. As a result, each lexical feature is mapped onto a separate voronoi cell whose neighborhood reflects the feature’s syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations with other features of the same space. The topology of the voronoi cells spans a voronoi diagram that visually represents the input text. Each of these cells is characterized by its filling level, transparency and height (third dimension) thereby reflecting its co-occurrence statistics within the input text, while the position and size of a cell is determined by the embedding of the corresponding feature – for the mathematical details of this algorithm see Mehler et al. (2016b). Finally, the text2voronoi algorithm extracts visual features from the voronoi diagrams to feed classifiers performing classifications of the input texts. </p>
            <p>LitViz utilizes the first three steps of this algorithm. Unlike the classical text2voronoi procedure, it does not address the final step of classification. Rather, it gives access to voronoi diagrams of input texts via a two-dimensional graphical interface, which can be transformed into a three-dimensional one by means of user interaction. These two- and threedimensional text representations can be used by the user of LitViz to interact with the underlying input texts in order to highlight single voronoi cells, to change her or his reading perspective or to visually compare voronoi diagrams of different texts. In this way, LitViz paves the way to a kind of a comparative distant reading by making accessible the visual depictions of different texts in an interactive manner.</p>
            <p>The LitViz Tool</p>
            <p>We have selected 18 authors of German literature each of whom is represent by 5 literary works. The works are taken from the Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org/) and visualized by means of the text2voronoi algorithm. Any of these examples is made accessible by the front page of LitViz (see Figure 3). When hovering over a voronoi cell of the voronoi diagram of a sample work, information about the underlying linguistic feature represented by this cell is displayed. According to Mehler et al. (2016b), we call these images VoTes: Voronoi diagram of a Text. LitViz presents VoTes via a graphical user interface for two- and three-dimensional interactive graphics. In this way, we go beyond Wattenberg’s 2D depictions of musical pieces.

            <p>
                <lb></lb>The second page (tab) of LitViz gives access to the comparison tool. Here the user first selects the number of VoTes to be compared. Then the user selects a subset of works of the authors to be compared. In the example in Figure 4, we compare four VoTes of two authors: two VoTes of two works of Heinrich Heine (top) and two VoTes of Heinrich Mann (bottom). It is easy to see that these VoTes fall into two classes, depending on the underlying authorship. Heinrich Mann’s two VoTes are organized around a center that is composed of many small cells, while there is a small subgroup of peripheral cells that are large. In contrast to this, the two VoTes of Heinrich Heine do not display such a center and are more evenly distributed in terms of their size. It is a main task of LitViz to allow for such comparisons. In this way, that is, by interacting with the texts’ image representations and by using the mouse-over technique, the user can study single features and how they are related to other features of the same representational space.

            <p>Conclusion</p>
            <p>We introduced a novel web tool, called LitViz, for visually depicting natural language texts based on the text2voronoi algorithm. LitViz enables the comparison of the visualizations of different texts. This allows, for example, for comparing the styles of the underlying authors visually. In this way, we extend the existing tool palette of distant reading. LitViz can be accessed via:

            <p>The poster introduces a project to develop a visualization application for a unique data source on Czech sciences. Information Register of R&amp;D Results (RIV) is the Czech Republic’s inventory of the outputs of basic and applied research since 1992. Although it is potentially an important source of data for analyses of various aspects of the intellectual organization and publication culture in Czech sciences, this particular data source has earned itself a pejorative nickname – “a coffee grinder” – for its central role in purely mechanistic science evaluation in the country.</p>
            <p>By employing text-mining technique that are standard in the digital humanities and by getting inspiration from visualization platforms such as 
                <ref target=""https://voyant-tools.org/"">
                    <hi rend=""italic"">Voyant Tools</hi>
                </ref> (Sinclair and Rockwell 2012), the project aims to contribute to the shift in the Czech narrative of science evaluation from the exclusively bibliometric perspective to a more diverse one. For example, the hope is that the visual display of the plethora of topics that are discussed in the research outputs registered in RIV will implicitly criticize the myopic vision in which all disciplines are leveled to the singular measure of the number of publications. The latter system is not only intellectually dubious, but it has had documented adverse effects on the quality of research results. Crucially, it stimulates institutions as well as individuals to prioritize quantity over quality (Good et al. 2015; Grančay, Vveinhardt, and Šumilo 2017).
            </p>
            <p>The ill-fated usage of the RIV data to mold nationwide fiscal policies for scientific research reminds us that data analytics is not necessarily a neutral enterprise. A proper treatment of the data is a matter that confronts a data analyst with questions on the borderline of ethics. Although it is perfectly feasible in technical terms, we wish to discourage users from attempts to track individuals researchers; instead we offer features that display institutional or disciplinary dimensions of the data (see Figure 1). Furthermore, the web application will provide a module to visualize textual information from the register. Textual strings, such as abstracts and keywords, have been part and parcel of the recorded entries, but have only served thus far as mere search terms. Meanwhile, the utility of textual data has been demonstrated in studies that strive to map the intellectual organization and relationships within and between disciplines (Leydesdroff 1989; Moody 2004).</p>

            <p>The target group of the application are the researchers themselves. Namely, the textual module is intended to serve their needs by providing an overview of the trending topics in research or to identify institutions working on similar problems. The specialist user sub-group is envisaged to come from the fields focusing on social and other studies of science. The accessibility of visualized data and the simplicity of the interface can also attract journalists or other members of the public. The prospective users are also likely to be recruit from among the stakeholders in scientific policy-making and management who may wish to gain quick insights into the quantitatively assessed rates of output per research institutions or funding bodies. </p>
            <p>The RIVVIZ application is developed in the R language and deployed on the R Server platform using the standard Shiny library. The data are imported from the publicly available repository of the Czech Research, Development and Innovation Information System. The internal setup is also fairly straightforward, relying predominately on the Tidyverse collection of packages, with ggplot2 library being the primary engine for visualization tasks. The underlying principles of the “grammar of graphics”(Wickham 2009) are particularly suitable for programming a user-oriented environment that allows for a control over a wide range of visualization parameters.</p>
            <p>Giving the users more choices should help to make them more engaged with the application, although there is a trade-off between user-friendliness and complexity. Reasonable defaults can partially alleviate this dilemma. The user engagement will be important for the future application development (Galey and Ruecker 2010). In the case of visualization schemes, locking users in a single – no matter how aesthetically pleasing – perspective is problematic. The apparent self-explanatory style and transparent communication of images may draw attention away from the complex and multifaceted nature of the data by making some of their aspects more easily accessible than others (Drucker 2011).</p>

                Overview
                <p>Pedagogical exercises in the digital humanities rely on student access to humanities data. While strategies range from instructor-prepared datasets (Sinclair and Rockwell, 2012) to having students digitize texts directly from print materials (Croxall, 2017), data repositories and web-based DH projects are two of the most attractive sources for identifying, appraising, and accessing data for classroom use.</p>
                <p>Yet data for teaching is rarely cited as a prime motivation or rationale for sharing research data. In “The Conundrum of Sharing Research Data,” Christine Borgman examines four rationales for sharing research data: (1) to reproduce or to verify research, (2) to make results of publicly funded research available to the public, (3) to enable others to ask new questions of extant data, and (4) to advance the state of research and innovation (2012). Pedagogy may be included implicitly in the third rationale, but by foregrounding pedagogical intentions, we can more readily operationalize a process for how we enable others to ask new questions of our data, which, in turn, will inform our motivations for sharing as well as the manner in which we do so.</p>
                <p>Web-based DH projects are often conceived and developed for public consumption with short-term support through grant funding. While initiatives such as these have proliferated since the 1990s, they often languish as legacy projects on institutional servers without clear plans for sustainability or sunsetting (Rockwell et al., 2014). Rather than construe long dormant projects as an institutional burden, these artifacts may continue to function as object lessons and raw materials for use in the DH classroom. Evaluating early digital projects based on their fitness for use as pedagogical datasets distinguishes the project from its component parts and allows aspects of the project to live on in new contexts.</p>
                <p>This panel will include representatives from five public research universities across the United States. We will begin with a brief overview, followed by four case studies. Each panelist will speak for fifteen to twenty minutes, leaving time for questions from—and conversations with—the audience. Cases are drawn from the DH 101 course at UCLA, the DH Librarianship course at the University of Washington, the University of Miami Libraries’ Legacy Site Adoption Project, and the Humanities Data workshop at DHOxSS. Our goal is to explore the intersection of data sharing and digital pedagogy to interrogate how past projects (whether formally archived or otherwise) are adopted as data sets for teaching and training; propose evaluation criteria for selecting these data sets; discuss what these classroom efforts indicate about the sustainability of DH projects (and their data); and examine how our knowledge of these classroom cases might inform curatorial decisions in active DH projects.</p>

                Learning from our mistakes: Using old projects to create better library/faculty collaborations
                <p>The Legacy Sites Adoption Project (LSAP) developed in response to what the library administration saw as a significant problem: the library website hosted nearly 40 digital projects built 5-20 years earlier by a former library faculty member, now malingering in various states of brokenness, but still placed prominently on the website. Retiring and removing the sites would erase the memory of the library’s institutional history, but repairing them would create an impossible burden for the web &amp; application development team; and would reinforce the idea of the library playing a service-and-support role in DH, rather than an active partnership.</p>
                <p>The solution that we are currently implementing is to experiment with making the legacy sites “adoptable”: the content and metadata of each site are made available as a zip file containing CSVs of data and metadata and accompanying images/audio/visual files, along with a readme pointing both to the current site on the library servers and an archived (and often more functional) version of the site in the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Faculty and students are able to use the zip files as base material for creating their own version(s) of the original sites, either carrying on the original concept as stated or taking it in a new direction. The original versions of the sites present opportunities for classes to think about developing DH projects with a direct focus on revision -- potentially reading and critiquing the original sites through the lenses of recent scholarly essays, or considering the choices made by the original creators in the light of how DH practices and tools have changed since the sites were built.</p>
                <p>LSAP engages with ongoing questions about what makes a good entry point into digital humanities work. Instead of building entry points around particular tools (Omeka, Voyant, etc.); or around a particular research question or collection of material that is not a project yet, adopting legacy sites centers and foregrounds the iterative nature and inevitable fragility of project webpages, while making explicit the relationship between the websites and the flat files of their content. </p>
                <p>With LSAP, we are also attempting a positive intervention into collaborative relationships between departmental faculty and librarians. Frequently, faculty come to librarians to ask for support for a particular idea for a digital project; or to incorporate digital methodologies into a classroom setting. In such instances, the faculty member may have little experience or knowledge with various key factors, including scoping and scaling project milestones, the availability of digitized objects, copyright/permissions restrictions, and the affordances of out-of-the-box tools. Our hope is that by offering projects that are ripe for revision, and focusing on areas that are frequently taught and studied at the university, we can provide an entry-point for collaboration that is more appropriately bounded, resulting in less uncertainty and less labor-intensive experiences for faculty, students, and librarians. </p>

                Awakening sleeping data for the DH classroom
                <p>As anyone who teaches digital humanities knows, humanities-related datasets are as hard to find as they are desirable. Since the closure of the Arts and Humanities Data Service in 2008, no centralized repository for humanities data has emerged. The DH instructor is faced with the necessity of scouring the web for data to share with students so that they can practice data-cleaning, -manipulation, and -visualization. Sometimes this data comes from libraries, archives, and museums, but it comes just as often from scholars’ long-hibernating research projects. Indeed, scholars are often surprised to learn that their data has taken on a new life as the basis for student projects.</p>
                <p>The last several decades have seen explosive growth in flexible, accessible tools for working with data. These new platforms offer possibilities for visualization and analysis that would only have been possible with custom programming just 10 or 15 years ago. Because of this palette of tools, even relatively inexperienced students can breathe new life into data left mostly untouched for years.</p>
                <p>This presentation offers some case studies of student projects built on “dormant” data, explaining how students are trained to analyze, contextualize, visualize, and make sense of data they had no involvement in collecting. It discusses best practices for providing this data, as well as a scaffolded approach to helping students become conversant in techniques for understanding and working with data. It suggests a “toolkit” of off-the-shelf platforms that are affordable and easy for students to grasp and shows how one can build on the other until even novice students are able to create full-fledged, sophisticated digital humanities projects in the space of a semester.</p>
                <p>For those who have collected data they wish to share with students, this presentation offers some suggestions for documenting, packaging, and contextualizing research data so that it is not only technically sound, but in a format that students can understand. It also offers a set of best practices for collaborating with students on a data-based research project, including methods for sharing, documenting, citing, and reusing data.</p>

                Fit for use: Repurposing research data, reconstructing provenance, and refining “clean” data
                <p>When it comes to teaching materials, data curation education may have become a victim of its own success: finding “dirty” data for classroom use is persistently difficult, in part because most published datasets have already been cleaned and curated! However, there are teachable moments to be found even when working with relatively “clean” data. Published data can be mined, re-structured, re-formatted and otherwise curated for new uses. Additionally, the process of tracking down and contextualizing already published datasets can prove instructive in and of itself. The detective work needed to understand someone else’s project, and to reconstruct its provenance, can reveal unexpected idiosyncrasies about the dataset, and thereby reveal useful data wrangling skills to be taught.</p>
                <p>In this talk, we describe our work finding, curating and reconstructing the provenance of “The Pettigrew Papers,” a published (and relatively clean) dataset we have used over two years of teaching week-long workshops on digital humanities data curation at the Digital Humanities at Oxford Summer School (DHOxSS). Thomas J. Pettigrew (also known as Thomas “Mummy” Pettigrew) was a Victorian surgeon, antiquarian, and Egypotologist. Pettigrew wrote several early texts on Egyptian mummies and was the founding treasurer of the British Archaeological Association. Though his correspondence is archived at Yale University’s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, it came to our attention via a “data paper” published in the Journal of Open Archaeology Data (Moshenska, 2012), containing transcriptions of select letters. </p>
                <p>In our first year teaching with the Pettigrew dataset, we wrote simple Python scripts to mine named entities from the letters, and to pull out header information about the letters as a spreadsheet for cleaning in OpenRefine. In hands-on sessions, we asked students to consider how they would clean and curate the dataset for new uses: what steps would need to be taken to create a network diagram of the entities named in his letters? To create a map of his correspondents? To create a timeline? </p>
                <p>In our second year teaching with this dataset, we spent more time reconstructing the original provenance of the Pettigrew letters themselves. In addition to the hands-on sessions from the first year, we asked students to consider how they might improve the metadata for the original data paper, and how they might resolve discrepancies between the data paper and the original finding aids created by the Beinecke (Ducharme, 2010). We additionally discussed how they might incorporate copies of Pettigrew’s publications available in the HathiTrust Digital Library in their work.</p>
                <p>Overall, we found that asking students to clean and re-curate this already published dataset was only the starting point in our teaching; as we found further connections in digital libraries and archives beyond the original data paper, we identified subtle and important issues in the digital humanities and digital curation that guided our workshop design. In addition to teaching hands-on data cleaning and manipulation skills, we found it important to teach students a nuanced understanding of provenance: both in the sense of the archival “chain of custody” that contextualizes and validates a fonds, and in the sense of the processes that led to a dataset’s current form.</p>

                Training DH librarians: Using old DH projects to move forward
                <p>The DH Librarianship course at the University of Washington Information School investigates the multiple roles librarians play in DH scholarship and prepares students for a wide range of career options in libraries, DH centers, and academic departments. DH librarian roles range from fully-credited collaborator with faculty to last-minute data cleaner, and everything in between. DH librarians also need to be prepared to support projects and research across the spectrum of disciplines, so we examine varying research methods across the humanities. The final project for the course asks that students locate an abandoned, or complete but aging DH project, and insert themselves as a librarian; they provide an evaluation of the content as well as the technology of the project and suggest ways to improve or update both.</p>
                <p>The data sets in these projects varies and examples include: hand-collated quotations by a famous author on a fan site; census numbers provided in a project about London families in the 17th century; a list of shooting locations for a television show; metadata for photos of logging camps in the Pacific Northwest; multimedia elements in a documentary film; boxes of music programs from a summer camp; and quilting patterns. </p>
                <p>Some projects also include the more typical (and larger) type of data set, such as those from HathiTrust or Google-generated Ngrams, but they have proven to be the exception. Working with small data sets means that cleaning doesn’t occupy much time during a 10-week quarter, and they can be rearranged quickly to utilize multiple visualization or data processing options.</p>
                <p>Students evaluate the data sets early in the process; in nearly all cases, data sets are either incomplete or inaccurate, and for some, updated data or other content is available. This is where the multi-disciplinary expertise of librarians comes in, as MLIS students are trained in searching out valid information sources from multiple perspectives, whether that’s using vendor-supplied databases, open web search engines, or (gasp) sources in print or microform. This is also where students begin to see the striation of roles between true collaborators, project leaders, subject specialists, technical consultants, or data-wranglers.</p>
                <p>In reviewing aging or abandoned projects, students learn how easily the data, other content, and the functionality of the site/project can be lost. This gives them the added perspective they need to start thinking about curation and preservation, rather than tackling those issues as add-ons if they have time.</p>
                <p>Through these immersive projects, students have a chance to see DH through multiple lenses: those of a potential user, a collaborator, and a disciplinary specialist. They learn how to re-create and improve on a project. In doing so, they gain experience in evaluating and collecting data as well as in multiple platforms and software that are prominent in DH (some current, some defunct). Some students also reach out to the original site or project owner, and in a few cases have worked with that person to update the project, putting preservation or stabilizing features in place for future users.</p>

            <p>Overview</p>
            <p>While scholarship on pedagogy in digital humanities has been growing, its focus has largely been on graduate and, to a lesser extent, undergraduate education. Yet, digital humanities pedagogy—namely its value for cultivating 21st century literacies tied to the production of knowledge and the ability to interpret digital media and computation—is as valuable, this panel argues, for middle- and high- school students as it is in higher education. Given that we are pursuing what Matthew Kirschenbaum describes as forms of ""scholarship and pedagogy that are bound up with infrastructure in ways that are deeper and more explicit than we are generally accustomed to"" (60), this panel examines the work of instructors who are beginning to plant the seeds of these new “customs” early on in humanities and social science training.</p>
            <p>Using digital humanities pedagogy in the middle- and high-school classroom, panelists argue, can redress gaps in these literacies. It enables students, as Mark Sample suggests, “[to think] through their engagement with seemingly incongruous materials, developing a critical thinking practice about process and product” (405). In this way, the approaches to digital humanities pedagogy in middle and high schools articulated by panelists are not an attempt to teach students particular technical skills, applications, or platforms. Rather, this pedagogical approach enables students to envision a relationship between themselves and knowledge production. </p>
            <p>The approaches to digital humanities voiced in this panel are rooted in digital humanities pedagogies in higher education, particularly project-based approaches to humanities knowledge that foster collaboration. As Tanya Clement has argued:</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend=""italic"" xml:space=""preserve"">Like pedagogy intended to teach students to read more critically, project-based learning in digital humanities demonstrates that when students learn how to study digital media, they are learning how to study knowledge production as it is represented in symbolic constructs that circulate within information systems that are themselves a form of knowledge production. </hi>(366)
            </p>
            <p>In the case studies and pedagogical approaches discussed by panelists, the project form complements more traditional forms of knowledge production and evaluation in the classroom. As Brett D. Hirsch argues, this “introduces a new mode of work that emphasizes collectivity and collaboration in the pursuit and creation of new knowledge” (16). While these new modes can be linked to participatory forms of culture, made possible by low barriers for civic engagement and creative expression online (Jenkins et al. 9), panelists make the case for greater attention to pedagogies that offer instruction to middle- and high-school students in collaborative production. </p>
            <p>However, as panelists argue, middle- and high-school pedagogies for digital humanities require attention to the unique needs of students in curricula, the developmental trajectories of the students, and the socio-economic dimensions of these students’ lives. In light of these concerns, what are the biggest challenges to doing digital humanities in middle and high schools? Which methods are most valuable and practically achievable? And how can we effectively prepare teachers to incorporate digital humanities into their teaching practices? In this panel we bring together an international team of researchers and faculty already engaged in answering these questions and implementing curricula in schools of education, digital humanities centers, and high schools. Our goal is both to present models and facilitate discussion with broader digital humanities communities about pedagogical infrastructures, methods, long-term goals, and the exciting possibility of cultivating digital humanities pipelines through intervention in middle and high schools.</p>

            <p>Designing Digital Humanities Pedagogy Infrastructures for Teachers</p>
            <p>Roopika Risam, Salem State University</p>
            <p>While digital humanities pedagogy has increasingly received attention from practitioners who want to teach their own students more effectively, how do we prepare 
                <hi rend=""italic"">teachers</hi> for the challenging task of engaging with digital humanities in their own classrooms? This talk offers an answer to this question by examining the digital humanities pedagogy infrastructure for middle- and high-school teachers designed at Salem State University. I first discuss findings from a study undertaken with teachers in Massachusetts to identify their attitudes towards digital humanities. The results indicate lack of knowledge about digital humanities but significant interest in incorporating computational approaches to humanities into teaching. Teachers also raised concerns including the time needed to learn technologies and teach them to students, cost of software and hardware, uneven access to computers or the internet in classrooms and for students at home, fear of implementing unsuccessful lessons, and a lack of professional development opportunities for digital humanities.
            </p>
            <p>This talk then considers the interdisciplinary graduate certificate in digital studies that Salem State University designed in response to the study. The program provides professional development while addressing teachers’ perceived obstacles to including digital humanities in their teaching. I discuss the relationship between study results and program design, focusing on development of core courses, selection of elective courses, differentiation of course delivery methods, integration into existing master’s programs, and creation of a directed study for curriculum design. To illustrate the impact of the program, I describe my work advising a team of teachers and administrators in the graduate certificate program who were planning technology needs for a new school building under construction and designing technology-infused curricula in English and History. While core and elective courses gave the teachers and administrators a solid background in digital humanities, a group directed study assisted the team with developing a scaffolded curriculum across middle-school humanities courses, designing classroom technology, and creating a professional learning community to provide in-school pedagogical support for teachers. </p>
            <p>Finally, this talk discusses a follow-up study with graduates of the certificate programs that assessed program outcomes. These outcomes include assignments implemented by teachers in their classrooms, exemplar student work, and a marked difference in attitudes and perceptions of teachers who completed the certificate in comparison to those who participated in the initial study. Based on the outcomes and the success of the graduate certificate program, Salem State has begun integrating digital humanities pedagogy directly into its teacher training programs. Consequently, this talk argues, this digital humanities pedagogical infrastructure for teachers serves as an effective model for addressing the barriers to incorporating digital humanities into middle- and high-school curricula for teachers who are already in the classroom and those preparing for teaching careers in the humanities. </p>
            <p>Digital Inquiry: The History of Youth</p>
            <p>Nina Rosenblatt, Trevor Day School</p>
            <p>David Thomas, Trevor Day School</p>
            <p>Stan Golanka, Trevor Day School</p>
            <p>On September 12th, 2017 Trevor Day School, an Independent School on the Upper East Side of New York City, launched two sections of an advanced history course entitled 
                <hi rend=""italic"">Digital Inquiry: The History of Youth</hi>. This course was the culmination of seven years of curriculum development work that began with a November 16th, 2010 article in the 
                <hi rend=""italic"">New York Times</hi> about Humanities 2.0 and the Stanford Republic of Letters Project. After an initial round of research we came to understand that digital projects had a role to play in our High School History curriculum. This realization coincided with our adoption of inquiry-based learning pedagogies. In a fundamental way, we argue, the techniques and disciplines involved in digital humanities allow high school students to conduct their own independent research in digital archives and become producers of history in their own right.
            </p>
            <p>In order to motivate students to collaborate and learn unfamiliar working methods, we developed our course around a subject that would engage all students. We wanted a subject that would not require a textbook, was accessible to juniors and seniors in high school, and would lend itself to seminar style classes. In addition, we wanted to be able to supplement the subject matter with texts illuminating the nature of historical narrative, archives, and the use of digital techniques in academic research such as the paper by Lauren Klein, “The Image of Absence: Archival Silence, Data Visualization, and James Hemings” in 
                <hi rend=""italic"" xml:space=""preserve"">American Literature </hi>Volume 85, Number 4, December 2013
                <hi rend=""italic"">.</hi>
                <hi rend=""color(333333)"" xml:space=""preserve"">The resulting course </hi>delved into the history of youth, looking at how being young is experienced and imagined differently in different times and places, and what we can learn about a society from its expectations for and attitude towards its youth, while teaching them production and analysis techniques for them to create new representations of that history.
            </p>
            <p>The final consideration was to craft a series of lesson plans to embed a digital humanities knowledge-production laboratory in the class. The course lab was divided into three modules: Digital editions and markup (an introduction to the fundamentals of plain text and markup), digital collections/exhibits (an introduction to the fundamentals of metadata and databases), and cultural analytics (an introduction to the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking and data mining). Through these modules the students were immersed in the process of selection, digitization, mark-up, the creation of a database/archive, data extraction and cleanup and data analysis, all driven by the imperative to create and interpret history. 
                <hi rend=""color(333333)"" xml:space=""preserve"">Technologies taught included, but were not limited to, command line, git, GitHub, plain text editors, Markdown, YAML, Jekyll, Omeka, Python and Voyant Tools. These technologies were directly tied to the </hi>variety of ways in which historians collect “data” including using literary, psychological, sociological, statistical, and visual sources, working towards creating our own historical knowledge using the digital tools for collecting, visualizing, mapping, and analyzing the information.
            </p>
            <p>In this panel we will present the results of our two course prototypes, lessons learned, future improvements, and argue for a generalizable model of instruction for high schools in the United States based on our experiences.</p>
            <p>Digital Literary Studies in the High School Environment</p>
            <p>Eric Rettberg, Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy</p>
            <p>What are the challenges of adapting a course in Digital Humanities and Digital Culture from the pedagogical environment of the university to that of the high school classroom? What new challenges arise from asking minors to produce digital and public scholarship, and how can digitally inflected scholars and teachers foster innovative humanities work in school environments bound to pre-existing curricula? In this talk, I use my experience adapting a class in Digital Literary Studies to the high-school level to share unexpected challenges and opportunities and to suggest digital work as a strategy for promoting the humanities to administrators, peers, and students in STEM-oriented high school environments.</p>
            <p>In early 2016, I left higher education to teach in the English department of the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, a state-funded boarding school for students talented in math and science. Given the immediate appeal of classes combining humanities with computing for STEM-focused students, I naively expected that I might be able to simply bring a college elective for English majors to my high school students. The actual challenges of doing so, however have been instructive: administrators have been less familiar with the existence of the methods of the Digital Humanities, digital assignments have had to be reframed to accommodate shared practice among teachers in my department, my school’s technology environment has needed to be customized to accommodate the software installations that I took for granted before, oversight from administrators, colleagues, and parents has been more intensive, and without the support staff available to me at my higher education institutions, I’ve had to think creatively around constraints. By demonstrating small-scale digital humanities work in core classes, designing a week-long intersession class on a similar topic, and sharing my knowledge of University-level digital humanities, though, I’ve been able to design a class that has colleagues and students excited.</p>
            <p>Heeding Ryan Cordell’s call to embed digital humanities instruction in larger narratives beyond “recent scholarly revolution,” I treat digital humanities praxis as one of three major components of change in literary production and study in the digital era. In addition to digital humanities projects centered on historical texts of students’ choice, students read and discuss fictive works that represent cultures of technology in the digital era and computationally enabled works of electronic literature. Throughout the class, students sample digital humanities practice in lab sessions and build small-scale web resources and undertake digital-humanities experiments in group projects. By exploring electronic texts, they begin to more fully recognizes the affordances of digital technologies, and by reading print texts that represent digital culture, they think about their own roles as consumers of and creators of digital tools and cultures. While my school’s student population and focus are especially suited to the STEAM focus that a class like this one offers, my experiences suggest that students at a wide variety of high schools would be engaged by these materials and skills.</p>
            <p>Impact od Digital Humanities on High School History and Heritage Teaching and Learning in the Caribbean</p>
            <p>Schuyler K Esprit, Create Caribbean, Inc.</p>
            <p>The experience of Create Caribbean Research Institute, the first Digital Humanities center in the English Speaking Caribbean tells an interesting story of how digital humanities can covertly and explicitly reshape the curriculum in history and literature of the Caribbean without necessarily requiring a massive paradigm shift of the national and regional curriculum requirements.</p>
            <p>In Dominica (where Create Caribbean operates) and the Eastern Caribbean – among other islands – the secondary education curriculum responds to the mandates of the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) who sets the CSEC and CAPE syllabi for high school and post-secondary certification in the region. These examinations frame the education curriculum for the five to six years of high school in many islands and many educators in this system find themselves bound to deliver content in limiting and limited methods in order to ensure that students simply meet requirements to excel at subject exams at Caribbean History and English B (Literature), which has a heavy focus on Caribbean Literature.</p>
            <p>However, students leave with an abstract and formalized understand of Caribbean history and culture, without a nuanced understanding of its relevance to their own lived experiences and the implications for their future. Create Caribbean uses digital humanities projects to reframe the conversation and disrupt traditional methods for learning. One of these projects uniquely highlights the potential for technology to change the face of education in Dominica and to get students more invested in Dominica’s history and culture. This project, made by students for students, can be found at 
                <ref target=""www.dominicahistory.org"">www.dominicahistory.org</ref>. The college student change-makers of Create Caribbean’s internship program build digital humanities projects with a primary and secondary student audience in mind. The example of dominicahistory.org highlights one way that a collaboration with a national organization has allowed for a broader consideration of the methods of heritage and culture education for students while actually providing solid academic source material for their formal study requirements.
            </p>
            <p>This presentation will discuss the origin, process and impacts of the Dominica History and Imagined Homeland digital projects of Create Caribbean as examples of disruptive secondary education. The presentation will also address the ways in which the projects have attracted the attention of high school teachers and transformed their interests in using technology to revise classroom experiences when they face limitations in adjusting other curricular frameworks.</p>
            <p>Precarity and Practicality: DH, New Media, &amp; Secondary Education</p>
            <p>Matt Appegate, Molloy College</p>
            <p>Jamie Cohen, Molloy College</p>
            <p>In 2015, faculty at Molloy College in Long Island worked with faculty and administrators to found the Baldwin High School New Media Academy, a co-organized effort to bring the study of New Media and Digital Humanities to underserved high school populations in Baldwin, New York. Working collectively, faculty at both institutions have established a curriculum and internship path at Baldwin High School that exposes students to methods of DH praxis and principles of New Media in a variety of means and environments (high school, college, in-person, online).</p>
            <p>Our curriculum is based on five modules and two college-credit bearing courses. Our modules include Critical Making, Digital Storytelling, Multimodal Composition, Online Expression, and Social Media. Our college-credit bearing courses are Introduction to New Media and College Composition (the course is taught entirely on the methods of multimodal composition). Each module is integrated into existing high school courses, i.e., Social Studies, English, Wood Shop, etc., where students take college-credit bearing courses in their junior and senior years. Ultimately, the “academy” concept introduces students to DH methods and New Media in a gradated process--students choose their academy prior to entering their freshman year of high school and are enrolled in courses that employ our modules.</p>
            <p>Our curriculum is based on principles of social good; it emphasizes both civic engagement and social justice, and provides sample assignments with grading rubrics for each module (Ratto). The civic-minded focus of our curriculum was developed in consultation with Baldwin High School, and fleshed out over 18 months of training. Our curriculum attempts to account for the precarious position women and people of color already inhabited in online spaces and demonstrate how DH methods and New Media principles can be mobilized to empower students via digital tools and languages. </p>
            <p>The focus of this paper is to report on our work with underserved high school populations and relay the challenges of bringing this kind of material to a secondary education setting. We focus on the practicalities of bringing DH methods and New Media principles to high school (i.e., funding, time, expertise, bureaucracy), as well as the necessary training that takes places between high school and college faculty (PT days, on campus conferences, and student events). Finally, we discuss the opportunities that working with underserved high school populations provides both politically and pedagogically. In this context, DH operates on a minimal scale, but addresses communal needs. </p>

            <p rend=""CM4"">Voyant Tools (voyant-tools.org) is a web-based reading and analysis environment for digital texts. Users can create their own corpus of texts to study by pointing to URLs or uploading files in a variety of formats (plain text, XML, HTML, PDF, MS Word, RTF, etc.). Voyant allows users to navigate between macro views of the corpus (e.g., a word cloud visualization of the entire corpus) and micro views (e.g., a reading individual occurrences of a specific term in context). The default interface provides access to a basic set of tools for reading texts and studying word frequency and distribution. There are also more tools available in various pre-defined or user-defined ‘skins’ (a layout of tools that are coupled). </p>
            <p rend=""CM4"">Voyant Tools is deliberately designed to be user-friendly and welcoming for text analysis. Voyant currently averages nearly 50,000 visits and about 750,000 tool invocations per month (not counting the downloadable instances of VoyantServer). This will be the seventh consecutive workshop of Voyant, with past sessions focusing on different aspects (pedagogy, multilingualism, customizability, standalone version, etc.). </p>
            <p rend=""CM4"">The 2015 workshop will focus on the second major release of Voyant Tools (2.0), which represents an entire rewrite of the codebase to address several of the major shortcomings and irritants of the currently available version 1.0. Version 2.0 is currently available in a beta version online with a major release due in early spring 2015. In addition to performance improvements throughout, the search and filtering functionality have been vastly enhanced, and Voyant now supports proximity and n-gram operations. Voyant 2.0 also has improved corpus handling. Documents can be reordered or added to corpora on the fly, and there is a lightweight access management layer that differentiates between full access, full-text access, and expressive/consumptive access. </p>
            <p rend=""CM4"">We have designed this workshop to be of interest both to new users of Voyant, who will get an introduction to the platform, and to existing users, who will discover all the new functionality 2.0 has to offer. As always, a crucial aspect of the workshop will be to get feedback from the community. </p>

Examples of changes include more powerful proximity and fuzzy searching of terms, infinite scrolling instead of paginated scrolling for tabular data, in-place modifications of corpora (adding documents or re-ordering them), and new tools (collocate networks, n-gram wordtrees, etc.). This part of the workshop will be useful both for users familiar with the old Voyant (to understand the changes and enhancements) and also to newcomers who will get a better sense of the variety of available tools. </p>

            <p rend=""CM4"">One benefit of the enhanced scalability of Voyant Tools 2.0 is the ability to bridge the gap between existing text repositories (typically focused on searching for documents) and analytic platforms (for text mining). We are collaborating with several large-scale content providers (like TCP-EEBO and Érudit.org) to create custom Voyant skins that allow users to search and filter within very large text collections in order to create smaller worksets of relevant documents for analysis. Because everything is happening in Voyant, the jump from text repository to text analysis is smooth and efficient (very few text repositories allow mass downloading of worksets, but even when they do, additional steps are typically required for re-ingesting the workset into an analytic platform). This component of the workshop will demonstrate some of our existing collaborations and describe how other content providers and projects might be able to leverage this hybrid functionality. </p>

Voyant Tools (voyant-tools.org) is a web-based reading and analysis environment for digital texts. Users can create their own corpus of texts to work with by pointing to URLs or uploading files in a variety of formats (plain text, XML, HTML, PDF, MS Word, RTF, etc.). Voyant allows users to navigate between macro views of the corpus (e.g. a word cloud visualization of the entire corpus) and micro views (e.g. a reading individual occurrences of a specific term in context). The default interface provides access to eight tools for reading texts and studying frequency and distribution data, and many more tools are available in various pre-defined or user-defined ""skins"" (a layout of tools that interact).

Using the hosted version of Voyant has several advantages. For instance, Voyant can be accessed immediately through most modern browsers and no software installation or configuration is required (some of the tools need plugins for Flash or Java, but not the ones in the default skin). Similarly, users are always accessing the most recent stable version of the web application, no actions are required by the user to update the software (typically, new builds with bug fixes and new functionality are released several times a month). A third benefit relates to Voyant's design as a networked tool where users can generate persistent URLs for their corpus and tools that can be stored, shared and embedded in remote sites.

The accessibility and convenience of the hosted version of Voyant also has disadvantages, however. Users often tell us they are wary of uploading texts to a server out of concern for possible copyright infringement or privacy issues. Consistent with its overall design priority of keeping things simple, Voyant does not currently have any user or access management system, so technically any uploaded content could be accessed by anyone (in practice, each uploaded corpus has a generated ID that it would be extremely unlikely to guess – so corpora are as hidden as users choose them to be). Still, with some material (protected responses to a survey that has required ethics approval, for instance), uploading content to a public, non-secure (non-SSL) site is not an acceptable option. A second potential source of frustration with the hosted version of Voyant is performance, especially with larger-scale text collections. The hosted server is configured to timeout after about 30 seconds, which can be insufficient when uploading, pre-processing and indexing a large text collection (the issue in some cases is not so much the scalability of Voyant as an application, but the constraints of a web application configured to support multiple concurrent users). Performance can also be an issue when running a workshop or tutorial with Voyant: 30 users hitting the same button at once can overwhelm the server (the current hosted deployment of Voyant runs in a ComputeCanada High Performance Computing facility but does not run as a cloud service that could smoothly expand capacity as on-demand). A final disadvantage with the hosted version of Voyant is that it requires reliable internet connectivity, which may be a mere nuisance at 30,000 feet, but a true problem at, say, a conference workshop with slow or unstable wireless. Performance, privacy, connectivity: three reasons among others to explore alternatives to using the hosted version of Voyant.

Workshop Outline
1) What is Voyant? (1 hour)

We will begin with a general introduction to Voyant within the broader landscape of digital text analysis. We will provide context and resources for working with digital texts. We will provide a brief overview of Voyant's user interface and discussion its strengths and weaknesses. We will suggest some other tools and techniques that may be of interest to workshop participants. This component of the workshop is like a mini-workshop on Voyant that will ensure a common base of familiarity with text analysis in general and Voyant in particular.

2) My Voyant (1 hour)

We will summarize some of the pros and cons of working with the hosted version of Voyant compared to running a local, stand-alone version. We will describe how to acquire a version of Voyant that can be run locally and then guide participants through running Voyant as a simple click-and-run desktop-style application. We will point out some of the most important technical aspects to be aware of, including how to understand the versioning system, where to find locally stored corpora, and how to respond to common errors.

3) Tweaking My Voyant (1 hour)

The nature of a web-application will be deliberately underemphasized in the previous component in favour of presenting My Voyant as a simple desktop-style application. This third component of the workshop will revisit the nature of My Voyant and explore ways that the web application can be tweaked to improve performance (memory settings in Java, server timeout settings, etc.) or otherwise fine-tuned (such as changing the default server port). The content will still be oriented around what's most relevant for a typical user of Voyant (not, say, a unix system administration guru). Finally, we will describe some strategies for deploying multiple instances of My Voyant for teaching/training purposes.

In most cases the hosted version of Voyant is probably still best in terms of convenience and sharing of work, but there are times where a local instance of Voyant may be preferable, especially with respect to performance, privacy and off-line access. This workshop, focused on using (not managing) My Voyant locally, will serve to expand the possibilities of doing digital text analysis.

Anderson;Corey E. Brady;Brian Broll;Lynn T. Ramey,"paper, specified ""short paper""","The Computational Thinking and Learning Initiative (CTLI) at Vanderbilt University formed out of an awareness that, across society and academe, computation is changing the nature of knowledge. As the practices and methods for producing, sharing, and contesting knowledge change, the enterprise of the university—its disciplinary scholarship, liberal arts mission, and charge to prepare professionals for the world of work—is being reshaped by algorithmic norms. The rise of computational thinking as a transdisciplinary category holds both promise and peril for the humanities. How can humanists, especially digital humanists, take advantage of the push for computational thinking across the curriculum while avoiding the dangers of appropriation? Alternatively, how can those developing and refining computational methods tap into the critical perspectives of the humanities? This paper discusses how an interdisciplinary group of colleagues is drawing on the theory of human-centered computing to develop environments and curricula for students of the humanities to explore the basics of text mining while also providing them with space to critique and resist the imposition of algorithmic rationality.The CTLI foregrounds a particular image of computational thinking across the curriculum, working to identify, stabilize, and study new forms of human-computer partnership that are responsive to disciplinary ways of knowing. Our aim is to study new ways in which individuals or groups of humans, along with computers or groups of computational entities, can come together productively and critically as collective computational-thinking units and build on complementary strengths to investigate problems while rejecting facile technical solutions. The perspective of human-centered computing, that is, the “design of computing systems with a human focus from beginning to end,”1 functions as an Archimedean point of our collaboration.A trans-institutional group of researchers and scholars have assembled at the CTLI, including faculty from the schools of arts and science, engineering, and education as well as the library and the data sciences institute. Together, we are exploring how human-centered computing collaborations transform epistemologies, practices, and pedagogies across disciplines.Following the programmatic overview that Anderson and Ramey presented at DH2019,2 these collaborators selected textual analysis as one of two focus areas (the other being climate change) for the first year of the initiative. Using NetsBlox,3 a block-based programming environment developed at Vanderbilt University, we constructed components and curricula to teach students in the humanities the fundamentals of computational thinking (variables, looping, functions, recursion, etc.) by manipulating textual corpora rather than matrices of numbers. We wanted this environment to be ""low threshold"" enough for middle and high school students to use it as an entry point to disciplinary inquiry, while having a sufficiently ""high ceiling"" to allow scholars of literature and history to use it meaningfully as well.Given our commitment to discipline-specific visions of computational thinking, our pilot project attempted to understand how the professional vision4 of the humanist might resonate with the technological capacity of new computational tools and methods. We viewed human-computer collaboration as an integration of productively-different ways of interacting with the objects of analysis (e.g., texts). Computers and humans “read” differently, and the trick was to find a way to put these ways-of-reading into conversation. We used design-based research5 to investigate possibilities, supporting and studying scholars' creative efforts to engage with technological tools and achieve what they regarded as progress on humanistic projects. We then developed a learning environment that enabled younger students to take on similar relations to computational tools, but in simpler, playful settings. Working with the same computational approaches at different levels of complexity and sophistication, we aimed to gain new perspectives on their power and limitations. We explored a design space with scholars and students centered on the analysis of style and affect in poetry, iteratively identifying and testing functionality with the ultimate objective of creating activities for both secondary-school and undergraduate courses.In the course of our explorations, we narrowed the team’s focus to three different technologies for textual analysis: (i) fundamental natural language processing concepts such as named entity recognition; (ii) word embeddings, such as Word2Vec;6 and (iii) a “query runner” to TEI-encoded documents in BaseX,7 a native XML database. During our collaboration, the team applied each of these technologies, first playfully, to explore what insights they could yield with familiar and constructed texts; then more deliberately, in settings in which it was likely that the computer’s “readings” might be put in productive conversation with humans’ readings. Finally, the team proposed questions, on the one hand, that revealed new patterns in larger corpora; and activities, on the other, that engaged younger learners in reflecting on style as a feature of writing under the writer’s control.In this paper, we report on this first year’s effort and our progress in building a block-based computing environment and curriculum that supports textual analysis by both high school students and professors of literature. We discuss how these tools and perspectives scaffold activities as diverse as teaching secondary students about the linguistic differences between poetry and prose and detecting stylistic patterns among Victorian writers. We also discuss the limitations of taking a human-centered computing approach when conducting digital humanities research; in particular, we examine the drawbacks of block-based languages for text mining in comparison with tools like Lexos8 and Voyant.9",txt,This text is republished here with permission from the original rights holder.,,block-based programming;computational thinking;human-centered computing,English,computer science;contemporary;curricular and pedagogical development and analysis;education/ pedagogy;english;north america;text mining and analysis

At the same time, it is important to make (digital) humanities scholars literate in dealing with visualizations to ensure that accurate conclusions can be drawn. In order to make younger generations ready for interdisciplinary work in a digital humanities context, I taught a module that attracted both computer science and humanities students. This article reflects on the most important aspects in teaching the course throughout three years.Cohort of studentsTeaching needs to be flexibly organized in dependency on the backgrounds of students joining a course. A course might be offered exclusively for either humanities or computer science students, or it can attract students with diverse study subjects. I faced different constellations, and emphasized different aspects according to the demands of the cohort. Whereas humanities students profit from more intense discussions on computational thinking and data modeling, it is especially helpful for computer science students to get to know typical research interests and traditional workflows of humanities scholars. The major focus should be to ensure that students, independent of their backgrounds, learn to “speak the same language” using the same terminology.Teaching visualization theoryTo serve students with an easy-to-digest overview of visualization design, I recommend Tamara Munzner’s book “Visualization Analysis and Design” (Munzner, 2014). It provides an introduction to data and task abstraction that are necessary to comprehend and to develop new or adapt existing visualizations. It further discusses how data features can be appropriately mapped to visual features, and how users can interact with visualizations. Also, emphasis should be devoted to Shneiderman’s Information Seeking Mantra “Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand” (Shneiderman, 1996) as it encapsulates the general idea of quantitative data analysis without losing the materials a visualization is composed of. This rather theoretical frame should be accomplished with discussing visualization techniques that are of particular importance for digital humanities research: geographical maps, timelines, tag clouds, heat maps and graphs.Ready-to-use-based vs. development-driven visualizationsNext to theoretical contents, the course should have a strong focus on practical work. It is known that different approaches to make use of visualization for knowledge discovery in digital humanities applications exist (Jänicke, 2016). The first approach is to apply ready-to-use tools like Voyant (Sinclair and Rockwell, 2020) for quantitative visual text analysis or Gephi (Bastian et al., 2009) for graph visualization. While the advantage of using such frameworks is generating arguable visual output in a short amount of time, research interests might deviate from what the tool can provide. Further, scholars need to learn how to use potentially complex tools and how to interpret upcoming results. In contrast to applying existing tools to generate visualizations, (digital) humanities and visualization scholars might also engage with each other aiming to generate a new visual vocabulary to expedite knowledge discovery, thereby facing the problems of interdisciplinary collaborations. While the first approach should be carried out simultaneously to the theoretical sessions, I recommend to conduct interdisciplinary student projects in the second part of the course.Supervisory roles during project workTraining to apply the learned visualization-related terminology should be the main focus of a project, while the visualization result itself plays a secondary role. Especially in a setting with mixed backgrounds, students should be engaged to think about potentially interesting project ideas. Each conducted project should include at least one participant with a (digital) humanities and one with a computer science background to expedite interdisciplinary exchange. This constraint generates different supervisory roles:The Mediator: Projects involve students having a computer science and a humanities background alike. The entire project is managed by the students, whereas the teacher might supervise in the form of a mediator during meetings. While students face typical pitfalls of interdisciplinary projects, such projects still brought forth considerable results, one of which is shown in Figure 1.The Real & the Fake Humanities Scholar: When the number of students with a humanities background is too low, project groups that only include computer science students need to be complemented with domain experts. For some of the projects, I was able to involve partners from the humanities, the real humanities scholars, with research interests targeted towards available data sets. This setting generated very good results (see Figure 2) and guaranteed the steepest learning curve for computer science students as they cooperated with domain experts experienced in digital humanities. However, for some projects I, educated in computer science, needed to act as a humanities scholar, being the least favorable setting as only fake interdisciplinary discussions are possible.The Helper: On the other hand, the number of computer science students joining a course might be limited. In that case, I could advise students in the role of a computer scientist, better suitable considering my own background. The focus in such projects was rather on data modeling and acquisition as well as applying existing tools and libraries than developing new solutions. An example is shown in Figure 3.Figure 1: The mediator project developed a method to semi-automatically extract biographical information about members of the German Bundestag in 2019, and the adapted stream visualization allows multifaceted exploration of biographical features.Figure 2: The real humanities scholar project focused on the development of an interactive tag cloud that supports composing engineering branches based on the study subjects of engineering professors. More information can be found in a related publication on the project (Meinecke and Jänicke, 2018).Figure 3: The helper project focused on the contents published at three German websites known for publishing fake news articles. For comparatively analyzing the results, the TagPies visualization (Jänicke et al., 2018) was adapted.I recommend making such courses accessible to all students as it prepares them best for potential future collaborations in a digital humanities context.

                What is computational thinking in the digital humanities?
                <p style=""text-align:left; "">The question whether digital humanists should learn to code has been highly-contested (Ramsay, 2011: 243–45). The ‘hack’ versus ‘yack’ debate has lost its edge as scholars concede that theory and programming praxis can be brought together productively through what Davidson terms “collaboration by difference” (Davidson, 2015: 134). Given that the majority of digital humanists will not need to program professionally, to what extent ought computation be taught in the digital humanities? Jeannette M. Wing coined the term “computational thinking” to address the teaching of digital literacy beyond computer science. She contended that “computational thinking is a fundamental skill for everyone, not just for computer scientists” (Wing, 2006: 33). In 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">Digital Humanities</hi>, Berry and Fagerjord comment at length on Wing’s definition, concluding that “a critical understanding of computing at its different levels is a prerequisite for a digital humanist...” (Berry and Fagerjord, 2017: 59). There is little agreement, however, about the best way to teach computational thinking to humanists. We review the potential of visual or “block-based” programming languages for teaching computational literacy in the digital humanities. We argue that digital humanists should learn from these tools’ emphasis on the ludic over the pragmatic. We also offer suggestions about how digital humanists might adapt and critically adopt block-based programming as they seek to expand their understanding of fundamental concepts of computer science.

                Review of educational programming environments
                <p style=""text-align:left; "">The use of visual or “block-based” programming has become a mainstay for computer science education in the K-12 arena. Block-based programming involves the manipulation of graphical elements to create units of computation. The authors of 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">Learnable Programming: Blocks and Beyond</hi> argue that block-based programming makes it easier to learn to program for three primary reasons: emphasizing recognition over recall, “chunking code,” and constraining options (Bau et al., 2017: 72–80). These pedagogical advantages would also seem to apply in the digital humanities though, as a quick review of the evolution of these languages demonstrates, they were not created to teach computational thinking to adults.

                        <hi rend=""bold"">Logo.</hi> The origins of block-based programming stretch back to Logo, a programming language and graphical environment for computer science education. While not a visual programming language, when paired with Turtle Graphics Logo provides students with the ability to visualize their computations (Papert, 1980: 16–20). Logo has gained renewed popularity among the elementary age set due to Gene Luen Yang and Mike Holmes’ 
                        <hi rend=""italic"">Secret Coders</hi>, a series of graphic novels that employs Logo to teach basic computational literacy (Yang and Holmes, 2015).

                        <hi rend=""bold"">Scratch.</hi> The designers of Scratch sought to create a computational environment for kids and teens to become active manipulators rather than passive consumers of digital media. The designers stripped away many of the complexities of software development (e.g., linking libraries and compiling binaries) to create what they term a “tinkerable” environment, pioneering the use of blocks for syntax (Maloney et al., 2010: 16:4).

                        <hi rend=""bold"">Snap!</hi> While Scratch succeeded in developing an extensive community of users in the K-12 arena, its emphasis on semantic simplicity inhibits its usefulness for teaching students computer science at the postsecondary level. The Snap! programming environment emerged from a collaboration between Brian Harvey at Berkeley and Jens Mönig, a software developer currently at SAP. Drawing on long experience teaching functional programming in Scheme, the authors created a semantics with lambda expressions, recursion, and high-order functions using a Scratch-like syntax (Harvey and Mönig, 2015: 35–38).

                        <hi rend=""bold"">NetsBlox</hi>. NetsBlox is an adaptation of Snap! that makes it straightforward for users to communicate with internet services and to communicate peer-to-peer (Broll et al., 2017: 81–86). Students can draw on these features of NetsBlox, for example, to place markers representing art museums in the vicinity on a Google Map or to create a shared digital whiteboard. By fostering the ability to communicate beyond the boundaries of the programmer’s laptop, NetsBlox paves the way for creating data-driven digital humanities projects. Data may also be persisted in the cloud, making it possible to preserve state. Currently, NetsBlox comes with the ability to call out to a select number of services. However, the developers envision “adding a lot of new services and data sources to NetsBlox...”(Broll et al., 2017: 86). This raises the question whether a version of NetsBlox could be developed specifically for digital humanists, integrating web-based application programming interfaces (or APIs) for platforms like the DPLA, the HathiTrust, and Europeana, among others.

Voyant Tools, for instance, provides a graphical interface for scholars seeking to study textual corpora (Sinclair et al., 2016). To date, there appears to be little to no scholarship about the pedagogical effectiveness of using visual programming environments in the digital humanities.</p>

                Programming as ludic rather than pragmatic
                <p style=""text-align:left; "">Is learning block-based programming a means to an end or an end in itself? While computer science students will inevitably move from block-based to text-based programming (Kölling et al., 2015: 29–38), the designers of Scratch claim that many students will fruitfully remain within its environment (Resnick et al., 2009: 66f). At the secondary and post-secondary level, “The Beauty and Joy of Computing” curriculum likewise promotes the enjoyment of programming within the Snap! environment: “having fun is an explicit course goal” (Garcia et al., 2015: 71). Leading digital humanists also acknowledge the playful aspects of programing. In “On Building,” Stephen Ramsay remarks, “Learn to code because it’s fun and because it will change the way you look at the world” (Ramsay, 2011: 245). Nick Montfort argues that motivations for learning programming go beyond the “merely instrumental” (Montfort, 2016: 268), remarking “it is enjoyable to write computer programs and to use them to create and discover” (Montfort, 2016: 277). By customizing the visual representations and selecting domain-specific exercises, block-based programming could find wide application in the digital humanities, promoting the joy of learning computation for its own sake while providing humanists with a better conceptual grounding for the evaluation and application of algorithms and software in their digital research.</p>

                Prolegomena to any future visual programming environment for the digital humanities
                <p style=""text-align:left; "">What would a digital humanities version of a block-based programing environment look like? By way of conclusion, we suggest how NetsBlox might evolve past its origins in Scratch to provide a shared platform for teaching computational thinking in the digital humanities. We propose three developments: 1. creating default sprites that represent the domains of digital humanities research (i.e. representing books rather than basketballs); 2. establishing libraries of blocks to call commonly-used web-based APIs in the digital humanities; 3. providing a curriculum focusing on major research areas in the digital humanities, including distant reading, educational gaming, geospatial analysis, and steganography, among other topics. By developing a block-based environment for the digital humanities, we hope not only to advance computational thinking in our field, but also to provide resources for introducing the digital humanities into secondary and postsecondary courses on computational thinking.</p>

            <p>IsiXhosa is an Nguni language classified in the south-eastern geographical zone of South Africa (Guthrie, 1971:33). It is one of the official South African languages, and one of the most widely spoken (after isiZulu) with approximately eight million mother-tongue speakers. In terms of natural language processing, particularly computational morphology, the Nguni languages including isiXhosa belong to the lesser-studied languages of the world and can be classified as under-resourced languages. Nguni languages are characterised by a rich agglutinating morphological structure, based on two principles: the nominal classification system and the concordial agreement system (Bosch &amp; Pretorius, 2008:97).</p>
            <p rend=""List Paragraph"">The principal author’s masters study focused on the representation of women protagonists by male and female authors in isiXhosa dramas. The whole analysis process was done manually, mainly because digitised isiXhosa literature books were not available. This limited the study to only four books. The analysis focused on gender inequality in the way women are represented by male authors, as opposed to the way in which women authors represent women protagonists, and also on patriarchal traces found in isiXhosa dramas.</p>
            <p rend=""List Paragraph"">
                <hi style=""font-family:Calisto MT;font-size:12pt"">When examining the representation of female protagonists in isiXhosa dramas, similar works from other scholars are noteworthy. The first contribution that narrates the same viewpoint as the one investigated here is by Ngqase (2002), in which she examines the representations of women in four isiXhosa drama books. The study highlights the interplay between culture and women's social space. The second contribution by Peter (2010) expresses female character portrayal in various drama works written by males. He concludes that many male writers are unwilling to portray female characters in their totality and true complexity, which is evident in the way some writers have resorted to the use of stereotypes (Peter, 2010:15).</hi>

For example, gender association in isiXhosa depends solely on the prefix. Only through the prefix will one be able to confirm whether a noun is referring to a single person or a group of people. Furthermore, only through contextualisation will one know whether that person is male or female, as isiXhosa prefixes are also unisex. </hi>

The Case of Château de Noisy,,Negin Eisazadeh;Barbara Bordalejo,"paper, specified ""short paper""","<text>
        
            <p>Urban exploration or urbex is the exploration of human-made spaces that are generally inaccessible and hidden away from the general public. Recording the visit of these ‘forgotten’ spaces through photography is a main component of this phenomenon which has resulted in a wealth of urban exploration photos and videos of abandoned sites. </p>
            <p>Urbex destinations are located worldwide and include a wide range of abandoned sites. Belgium has been a very popular destination for urban explorers and Château de Noisy, a neo-gothic castle in Belgium dating back to the 19
                <hi rend=""superscript"">th</hi> century was a very famous destination which was demolished in 2017. There is a rich collection of urbex materials on this building which urban explorers have shared through various online platforms, such as personal websites, Facebook, YouTube, and Flickr. The latter has become a significant repository of urban exploration photographs. 
            </p>
            <p>Regardless of the social and political complexities of this phenomenon, urban exploration is intertwined with abandoned historic sites and in recent years the potential of urban exploration for preservation of heritage has been brought to the attention of academia. Considering that urban exploration is becoming increasingly popular, the importance and possible contribution of this activity and its records for research on abandoned heritage sites cannot be neglected.</p>
            <p>This research focuses on the documentation and information management of abandoned heritage sites and looks into the potentials of the rich collection of existing digital urbex resources for their preservation by exploring their content and new means of representation and engagement. The unique value of such iconographic data can be attributed to the fact that normally these abandoned sites are inaccessible to the general public. Hence these photos and videos can shed light on these unknown places, and with the right utilization can not only document and digitally preserve some aspects of the valuable heritage but also can bring public attention to heritage sites that may still be saved from deterioration and revived. </p>
            <p>To explore the potentials of urbex produced materials for heritage preservation, concentrating on the rich collection of urbex data of numerous abandoned sites, this research aims to gain insights into the urbex scene and its evolution. Moreover, focusing on Château de Noisy, considering that the prevalent methods of documentation of a historic site which require physical access and presence are not applicable, it aims to explore the potential of ‘distant documentation’ by investigating the application of existing tools and software to create a new approach for the preservation of abandoned and even demolished heritage sites and their story. To reach these objectives, focusing on Flickr and using the Flickr API service, two Flickr Dataset are collected: One of general photos related to urban exploration on Flickr (from 2000 to 2017) and another which includes the specific photos of Château de Noisy on Flickr. To collect, prepare, visualize, analyse, create and present the data for this study multiple tools and methods are employed: Python Scripting Language (collection and preparation), Tableau Desktop (visualization and analysis), Voyant (textual analysis), ContextCapture (creation/reconstruction) and WebStorm (presentation via the creation of a website). </p>
            <p>Terminology of the urbex Flickr photo titles and visualizing the distribution of the urbex Flickr photos, led to interesting insights into the urbex scene. Furthermore, the collected and downloaded images of Château de Noisy from Flickr offer insights into this abandoned building carrying information on diverse aspects such as its function, materials (and pathology), structure and context over the course of many years. </p>
            <p>Château de Noisy was demolished without being given the chance for detailed documentation through advanced 
                <hi rend=""italic"">in situ</hi> techniques. Using the ContextCapture software and a selection of the images and videos of the castle that were identified through retrieving the images of the Château de Noisy Flickr Dataset, a 3D mesh model of the building and its immediate context is created. This scalable 3D reconstructed model can allow a flexible interactive experience of the site and can be used to curate and create an immersive experience of the exterior of the building and its immediate context while providing additional heritage information. A digital reconstruction of the building and subsequent narration that builds upon this vessel can create an engaging and immersive experience for the public and digitally preserve the ‘fairytale castle’ building that once stood in Celles. The experience of such distant documentation of Château de Noisy can also be implemented in other heritage sites which are demolished or inaccessible. For buildings that still exist, raising awareness of its current state and heritage values can lead to their potential preservation and revival.

            <p>The emergence of computational methods of text processing has created new paradigms of research in literary studies in recent years (Jockers & Underwood, 2016), for instance 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">distant reading</hi> to find patterns and regularities (Moretti, 2005). Network analysis and extraction of information about relations between characters from literary texts is an example for distant reading methods. Such information can not only be helpful for better understanding of character interactions but can also facilitate the comparison of thereof in different texts.

                    <ref target=""ftn2"" n=""2""/> are either missing modules for character network analysis or require preliminary steps on data preprocessing from the user and therefore are not easy-to-use for some humanities scholars who lack programming skills. Interactive tools in addition often lack features to ensure reproducibility of results.
                </p>
            <p>We present our ongoing effort on closing this gap by developing a literary analysis reporting tool 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">rCAT</hi>
               <hi rend=""italic"">
                  <ref target=""ftn3"" n=""3""/>
               </hi>, whose primary purpose is to provide an easy-to-use, stable, and reusable solution for automatic extraction of relational information from text and to characterize these relationships automatically to provide the user with deeper qualitative insight. We opt for implementation as a web-based reporting tool instead of an interactive tool for two reasons: (1) automatically generated reports in PDF format can serve as a stable foundation for discussion and can be reused in publications and visualizations easily, and (2) the results are clearly connected to the chosen input parameters such that reproducibility of results is ensured.
                </p>
            <p>As a use-case study, we apply 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">rCAT</hi> to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's epistolary novel 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">Die Leiden des jungen Werthers</hi>. On the basis of this epistolary novel, we show that not only the network can be generated, but also the characteristic triangular relationship of the protagonists is easily identified. The goal is to automatically determine this triad in the original text and in the adaptations that have been published since the publication of 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">Werther</hi> in 1774.

                </head>
            <p>Previous research on social networks in literary fiction generally fall into one of the two categories: (1) works that explore methods for extracting and formalizing character networks (
                    <hi rend=""italic"">cf</hi>., Elson et al. (2010), Agarwal et al. (2012, 2013), Park et al. (2012)), and (2) works that primarily focus on qualitative implications of network analysis (
                    <hi rend=""italic"">cf</hi>., Rydberg-Cox (2011), Moretti (2011), Nalisnick & Baird (2013), Jayannavar et al. (2015)). It is common to address both tasks at the same time, as in Beveridge & Shan (2016), who introduce a number of formal measures for analyzing the centrality of the characters in 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">Game of Thrones</hi> books, which results in both expected and surprising findings. 
                </p>
            <p>Building on graph theory extensively elaborated in the past fifty years (e.g., Bondy and Murty, 1976 or West, 2001), our work is similar to Beveridge & Shan (2016), in particular, in terms of the weighted degree measure, and to Park et al. (2012), in terms of distance measure for detecting closely related characters in a text.</p>

               <p>To detect character mentions in the text we use a fundamental named-entity recognition approach based on dictionaries. This approach is suitable for scholars who analyze texts they already know. Consequently, we opt for a transparent and simple character recognition procedure: The user provides a list of character names to be included in the analysis specifying a canonical name form and all variations thereof she would like to take into account (
                         <hi rend=""italic"">e.g.</hi>, “Lotte” is the canonical name and “Lotten”, “Lottens”, “Lottgen”, “Lottchen”, “Charlotten S.”. are its variants).

                </head>
            <p>For a use-case analysis, we apply 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">rCAT</hi> to 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">Die Leiden des jungen Werther</hi> by Johann Wolfgang Goethe with the following parameters: X=8, Y=5, stop words removed (previous work focused on this analysis without rCAT, 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">cf. </hi>Murr, 2017).
                </p>
            <p>In Goethe's epistolary novel, the protagonist Werther describes his unhappy love for Lotte, who is engaged to Albert. The characteristic triangular relationship in the novel arises from this constellation (protagonist - beloved woman - antagonist). With 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">rCAT</hi> we expect to identify and characterize this relationship. Figures 1 and 2 show a sample network analysis output (tables are shown only partly).
                </p>
            <p>The protagonist Werther shows a degree of 21, which is the number of characters with whom he interacts. The closest relationship measured by edge weight (Figure 2) is observed between Werther and Lotte (81 interactions). The antagonist Albert has a low degree of 3. However, his weighted degree is 36 (third highest after Werther and Lotte), which confirms his important role in the triangular relationship.</p>

            <p>Highlighted in red is the typical triangular relationship in Goethe’s novel, which corresponds to the three highest weighted degrees. In further steps, we will use 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">rCAT</hi> to analyze the adaptations of Goethe's novel with a focus on this triad.
                </p>
            <p>To better characterize the edges, the tool outputs top-
                    <hi rend=""italic"">n</hi> word clouds sorted by edge weight (
                    <hi rend=""italic"">n</hi> is specified by the user) for character pairs and by degree for single characters. Figure 4 and 5 show examples of the word clouds for character pairs filtered to the words from the emotion domain.

            </p>
            <p>The word clouds enable first conclusions about the relationships of the characters. Werther and Lotte's word cloud characterizes their ambivalent relationship. The key words ""Leidenschaft"" and ""Freude"" reflect Werther's love, whereas the mentions of ""sterben"" and ""Verblendung"" are characteristic of the unrequited love, which leads Werther into his ""disease unto death"". As Werther and Albert’s word cloud reveals, their relationship is dominated by the ""Unruhe"" that Werther feels through his adversary. </p>
            <p>Additionally, the tool plots the development of the narrative (not bound to specific characters) based on the word fields, an example of which is shown on Figure 6. In this case we used words from the emotion domain (with emotion dictionaries by Klinger et al. (2016)).</p>
            <p>
               <figure>
                  <graphic url=""KLINGER_Roman_A_Reporting_Tool_for_Relational_Visualization_-10000000000002C600000315B691CA7597929A2D.png""/>
                  <head>Illustration 6: Word field development for Goethe’s Werther</head>
               </figure>
            </p>
            <p>The word field development can highlight the prevalence of individual emotion domains across the text. The accumulation of the negative emotion words (Wut,Trauer, Furcht) towards the end suggests, for example, that Goethe’s novel has no “happy ending”. The striking rash on “Freude”, however, captures the last happy hours Werther spends with Lotte in the second part of the narration before he kills himself.</p>

            <p>Die Arbeit zur digitalen historischen Semantik in Frankfurt am Main erreicht mit der neuen webbasierten Plattform und Datenbank „Latin Text Archive“ 
                (LTA)<ref target=""ftn1"" n=""1""/> im Rahmen der Dateninfrastrukturen der Berlin-Brandenburgischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (BBAW) ein neues Level. Nach über zehn Jahren Entwicklungsarbeit an den Datenbanken „Historical Semantics Corpus Management 
                (HSCM)“<ref target=""ftn2"" n=""2""/>, „Frankfurt Latin Lexicon (FLL)“ sowie an der Webseite 
                „www.comphistsem.org“<ref target=""ftn3"" n=""3""/> ergaben sich drei grundlegende Herausforderungen: (1) Nachhaltigkeit und Verfügbarkeit der geleisteten Arbeit mussten gesichert, (2) Benutzerfreundlichkeit und Funktionalität verbessert sowie (3) Akzeptanz und Verankerung innerhalb der Fachwissenschaft gesteigert werden. Das LTA antwortet auf diese Herausforderungen und führt mit historischen Referenzkorpora neue Arbeitsinstrumente ein. Das LTA ist auch das Ergebnis einer neuen strategischen Partnerschaft, um die bisherige Arbeit aus der stets zeitlich begrenzten Projektentwicklung an der Universität in einen dauerhaften Betrieb an einer Akademie zu überführen. 
                </p>
            <p>Zur Standortbestimmung der Frankfurter Arbeit lässt sich Michael Piotrowskis Definition von 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">digital humanities</hi> (Piotrowski 2018: 2) anwenden: Danach ist sie den 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">applied digital humanities</hi> zuzuorten, da ein konkretes geschichtswissenschaftliches Forschungsziel mit digitalen Techniken verfolgt wird. Der Historiker Bernhard Jussen hat zur Umsetzung seines Postulates einer „kulturellen Semantik“ nach Wegen gesucht, wie computerlinguistische Methoden helfen können, Bedingungen, Mittel und Formen multimedialer Sinnproduktion in vergangenen Gesellschaften zu erforschen (Jussen 2000: 24ff.). Es geht um die kontrollierte Analyse von semantischem Wandel innerhalb der lateinischen Textproduktion in poströmischer Zeit. Ein Anwendungsgebiet ist die politische Geschichte. So lässt sich mittels der computergestützten Semantik danach fragen, welche impliziten politischen Ordnungsmodelle in Texten sichtbar werden, bevor mit der Wiederentdeckung der Politik des Aristoteles der Begriff des Politischen aufkommt? Außerdem kann die Begriffs- und Ideengeschichte Verwendungszusammenhänge von zentralen Vokabeln untersuchen (Geelhaar 2015; Schwandt 2018). Am Ende sollen aber nicht nur Forschungsergebnisse und -methoden, sondern auch Arbeitsinstrumente und Forschungsdaten einem breiten fachwissenschaftlichen Publikum ohne Programmierkenntnissen zur Weiterverwendung bereitstehen. Hierzu hat Bernhard Jussen den Computerlinguisten Alexander Mehler und dessen Text Technology 
                    Laboratory<ref target=""ftn4"" n=""4""/> für eine Kooperation gewonnen, in der die texttechnologische und die geschichtswissenschaftliche Seite ihre jeweiligen Agenden verfolgen und vom interdisziplinären Austausch profitieren. Aus dieser Konstellation ergibt sich, dass die Vorstellung des LTA aus geschichtswissenschaftlicher Perspektive den Fokus nicht auf technische bzw. technologische, sondern auf programmatische und anwenderbezogene Aspekte legt.

         <div type=""div1"" rend=""DH-Heading1"">
            <head>Das Latin Text Archive: Teil des DTA-Markenstamms</head>
            <p>Das LTA ist eine frei zugängliche, webbasierte Plattform zu Korpusaufbau und Korpusanalyse sowie auch eine Datenbank. Technisch baut es auf den am Deutschen Textarchiv (DTA, DFG-gefördert zwischen 2007 und 2016, siehe Geyken et al. 2018) entwickelten Komponenten zur Textpräsentation auf und erweitert somit den Markenstamm des DTA um eine lateinische Textkomponente. Diese umfasst die Textproduktion im lateinischsprachigen Europa von (zunächst) 400 bis 1500. Die versammelten Texte basieren auf kritischen und somit für die Geschichtswissenschaft validen Editionen, soweit sie in Open Access verfügbar sind. Sie werden zum Zweck des Text Mining um den kritischen Apparat 
                gekürzt<ref target=""ftn5"" n=""5""/>, im TEI-P5-Format nach dem für HSCM entwickelten Datenmodell aufbereitet, vollständig lemmatisiert und mit einer aufwändigen Metadaten-Annotierung angereicht, die zugleich die Vernetzung zu anderen digitalen Ressourcen herstellt – nicht zuletzt zu den textgebenden Institutionen 
                selbst.<ref target=""ftn6"" n=""6""/> Hierbei handelt es sich u. a. um die 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">Monumenta Germaniae Historica</hi> (MGH). Dieses wichtige deutsche Editionsunternehmen für mittelalterliche Texte stellt seine Editionen im „openMGH“-Projekt unter Creative-Commons-Lizenz in TEI-konformen Versionen zur 
                    Verfügung.<ref target=""ftn7"" n=""7""/> Doch erst durch die Datenintegration ins LTA können auch reine Anwender vom openMGH-Projekt profitieren, da die Editionen nun erst wortstatistisch vergleichend analysiert werden können. Des Weiteren ist das LTA auf kontrollierte Datenerweiterung durch die gezielte Aufbereitung und Übernahme aus projektexternen Quellen ausgelegt, um in Zukunft ein repräsentatives Korpus historischer, lateinischer Textproduktion analysierbar zu machen. Hierzu können die Daten entweder als Gesamtkorpus und nach freier Auswahl durch den Anwender an Analysemodule weitergereicht werden, von denen die Voyant Tools bereits verfügbar 
                    sind.<ref target=""ftn8"" n=""8""/> Die in den Vorgängerprojekten entwickelten Analysetools werden als weiteres, externes Modul zugänglich gemacht. Dabei handelt es sich um Konkordanz- und Kookkurrenzanalysen sowie die Berechnung semantischer Netzwerke. 
                </p>

            <head>Zusammenhang zwischen LTA und HSCM</head>
            <p>Das LTA unterscheidet sich in mehrfacher Hinsicht von seinen Vorgängeranwendungen. Die Überführung des Datenbestandes aus HSCM in das LTA als Teil der von der BBAW betreuten Dateninfrastruktur dient dem Zweck der nachhaltigen Verfügbarkeit. Zudem wird das LTA als explizites Parallelangebot zum DTA vom Renommee der BBAW profitieren, die durch eigene Datenprojekte nicht nur eine ausgezeichnete Expertise in den DH vorweisen kann, sondern auch bereits hohe Anerkennung in den Geisteswissenschaften genießt. Zudem gewinnt das LTA durch die Anlehnung an das DTA, da es einen Wiedererkennungseffekt in der Benutzerführung gibt, der das Arbeiten mit dem LTA erleichtert. Die wesentlichen Neuerungen gegenüber HSCM bestehen aber nicht nur in der verbesserten Benutzerführung; wichtiger noch ist die Trennung der Primärdatenaufbereitung von der Datenverwaltung, indem die Daten in HSCM kuratiert und im LTA zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Das Preprocessing neuer Texte wird weiterhin über HSCM als Teil des eHumanities-
                Desktops<ref target=""ftn9"" n=""9""/> laufen und über den eigens vom Text Technology Lab entwickelten TT Lab Tagger (vor der Brück/Mehler 2016; Eger/Gleim/Mehler 2016) für die automatische Lemmatisierung lateinischer Texte, über das dafür nötige morphologische Lexikon („Frankfurt Latin Lexicon“) sowie über Editoren zur kontrollierenden, manuellen Nachlemmatisierung und zur nachträglichen Korrektur des TEI-Codes. Die vollständig bearbeiteten Texte werden anschließend in das LTA überführt, wo es nicht mehr möglich sein wird, in den jeweiligen Source-Code des Textes einzugreifen. Dies erlaubt eine feste Indexierung (auch der Lemmatisierungsinformationen), wodurch die Schnelligkeit bei der Verarbeitung von Suchanfragen bedeutend gesteigert wird. Darüber hinaus ist durch den Datentransfer die Analyse des Materials nicht mehr auf die in HSCM vorhandenen Tools beschränkt, sondern können im Grunde von allen denkbaren Toolkits wie eben den Voyant Tools oder 
                Diacollo<ref target=""ftn10"" n=""10""/> weiterverwendet werden.

         </div>
         <div type=""div1"" rend=""DH-Heading1"">
            <head>Geschichtswissenschaftliche Referenzkorpora</head>
            <p>Die dritte wesentliche Neuerung sind die unter geschichtswissenschaftlichen Aspekten kontrollierten 
                Referenzkorpora<ref target=""ftn11"" n=""11""/>, um Veränderungen im Sprachgebrauch zeitlich wie genrespezifisch berechnen und visualisieren zu können. Wie die DTA-Referenzkorpora beinhalten diese Referenzkorpora ganze Werke und nicht nur Samples wie linguistische Korpora (z. B. das British National Corpus). Das Clustering von Texten wird nach Vierteljahrhunderten und nicht nach Zehn-Jahres-Schritten wie im DTA 
                geschehen<ref target=""ftn12"" n=""12""/>, weil eine präzisere zeitliche Zuordnung aufgrund fehlender Datierungen und mitunter komplizierten Überlieferungsgeschichten nicht möglich ist. Dieser Arbeitsschritt erforderte zudem eine erneute klassische Quellenkritik zur Chronologie einzelner Texte. Die Textmengen pro Zeiteinheit sollen quantitativ nicht zu sehr voneinander abweichen, was angesichts der teilweise eklatanten Disparität historischer Schriftproduktion eine große Herausforderung darstellt. Außerdem wird, soweit möglich, der Verbreitungsgrad handschriftlicher Überlieferung berücksichtigt, wenngleich das LTA ansonsten an der Idee des Textes als abstrakter Größe aus konzeptionellen Gründen festhalten 
                muss.<ref target=""ftn13"" n=""13""/> Das erste Referenzkorpus besteht aus narrativen Texten, die aus den Scriptores-Reihen der MGH stammen und historiographische wie hagiographische Texte beinhalten. Künftige Korpora werden Briefe bzw. Urkunden und vor allem auch theologische bzw. juristische Traktate umfassen, um somit Sprachgebrauch in verschiedenen Genres vergleichen zu können.

               <hi style=""font-size:11pt"">”Auf der Konferenz [DHd 2018; d. Verf.] war zu jeder Zeit an jedem Ort genug Kompetenz versammelt, um in einer Kaffeepause eine digitale Publikation der Abstracts zu bauen, mit Inhaltsverzeichnis, Volltext- und Schlagwortsuche und anderen netten Features, die sonst zum Standard jeder Webpräsentation in den DH gehören.” So postuliert Fabian Cremer in seinem Blog-Post “Nun sag, wie hältst Du es mit dem Digitalen Publizieren, Digital Humanities?” (Cremer 2018). Nur, wie Cremer weiter ausführt, niemand habe es gemacht oder irrt der Autor in dieser Aussage, da die Aufgabe nicht so trivial ist, wie auf dem ersten Blick erscheint? Der hier vorgeschlagene Workshop “DHd 2019 Book of Abstracts Hackathon” soll der DHd-Community den Raum bieten, dieser Frage nachzugehen, eine gemeinsame digitale Publikation der Konferenz-Abstracts zu realisieren und so einen Diskussionsimpuls zur Zukunft des Digitalen Publizierens in den Digital Humanities zu geben.  </hi>

            <head>Digitales Publizieren und Digital Humanities</head>
            <p>
               <hi style=""font-size:11pt"">Das digitale Publizieren hat sich im Rahmen des Kanonisierungsprozesses zu einem etablierten Bestandteil der Digital Humanities entwickelt. Dies umfasst sowohl methodische Überlegungen (Kohle 2017) wie auch die praktische Umsetzungen (DHd-AG 2016). Längst existieren etablierte digitale Publikationsorgane der Digital Humanities, welche die Vielfalt und Potentiale der digitalen Publikationsformate demonstrieren und als Vorbild der Publikationspraxis und Wissenschaftskommunikation 
                    gelten.</hi>
               <ref target=""ftn1"" n=""1""/>
               <hi style=""font-size:11pt"" space=""preserve""> Diesen Entwicklungen zum Trotz werden in der Breite und Spitze der Digital Humanities Forschung diese Potentiale nicht ausgeschöpft und traditionelle Publikationspraktiken weiterhin gepflegt (Stäcker 2012). Dies gilt für die Ebene der Technologie, so liegt das Book of Abstracts der DHd 2018 als PDF ohne Strukturdaten vor (Vogeler 2018). Aber gleichfalls auch für die offene Zugänglichkeit, so wurde das deutschsprachige Standardwerk zu den DH nicht als Open Access publiziert (Jannidis et al. 2017 vgl. dazu Stäcker 2017). Die Anforderungen an digitale Publikationen sind schon seit längerem formuliert. “Digital publishing is not simply repackaging a book or article as a computer file, although even a searchable pdf has advantages over paper”, bemerkt Borgman in ihrem “Call to Action for the Humanities” und adressiert hier auch dezidiert die Digital Humanities (Borgman 2010: #p16).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi style=""font-size:11pt"">Neben den wissenschaftsökonomischen und wissenschaftspolitischen Vorteilen digitalen Publizierens eröffnen digitale Formate neue wissenschaftliche Methoden zur Weiterverarbeitung. Diese Potentiale sind sich insbesondere die mit digitalen Quellen und Daten arbeitenden  Geisteswissenschaftler*innen bewusst und Formulieren entsprechende Ansprüche an die Digitalisierung und Bereitstellung der Untersuchungsgegenstände, wie etwa Volltexte mit standardisierter Strukturierung und Interoperabilität sowie mit Entitäten und komplexen Strukturmerkmalen angereichert 
                    (Klaffki et al. 2018: 19-20).</hi>
               <ref target=""ftn2"" n=""2""/>
               <hi style=""font-size:11pt"" space=""preserve""> Diese Ansprüche müssten in den Geisteswissenschaften, in der die eigenen Texte in Form einer kritischen Rezeption und Iteration Teil der Informationsquellen sind, auch an die eigene Textproduktion gestellt werden. Folgerichtig lautet die Empfehlung der DHd-AG “Digitales Publizieren”, die semantischen Strukturen zu kodieren, die Dokumente maschinenlesbar und prozessierbar zu machen und PDF nicht als primäres Publikationsformat zu verwenden (DHd-AG 2016). Die TEI-basierten Veröffentlichungen der Digital Humanities Community demonstrieren das Potential der Publikationen als Untersuchungsgegenstand des Faches (Sahle/Henny-Krahmer 2018 und Hannesschläger/Andorfer 2018). Allein die Zusammenführung der strukturierten Datenbasis der Texte mit den vorhandenen Technologien und Methoden neuer Publikationsformate steht häufig noch aus. Diese Lücke adressiert das vorliegende Konzept.</hi>

                  <hi style=""font-size:11pt"">Der Hackathon liefert einerseits ein Proof-of-Concept für die Implementierung digitaler Technologien in einen Publikationsprozess (der digitalen Geisteswissenschaften) und möchte andererseits ein partizipatives Format zur Unterstützung der DHd-Tagung durch die DHd-Community in kollaborativer Arbeitsform (Hackathon) darstellen. Der Einsatz vorhandener Frameworks aus der Community demonstriert die Leistungsfähigkeit und das vorhandene Potential. Die erarbeiteten Transformationsskripte und Workflows können die Basis für eine Weiterentwicklung und Nachnutzung in institutionellen Publikationsprozessen darstellen. Eine Analyse des Workshops, der Ergebnisse und der damit verbundenen Rezeption liefert die Grundlage für die Formulierung von Empfehlungen zum möglichen zukünftigen Umgang mit den DHd-Abstracts und deren stetig steigende Relevanz als Publikationsformat. Der Hackathon kann dabei sowohl technologische wie methodische Impulse für das Digitale Publizieren in der DHd-Community liefern.</hi>

Die parallel arbeitenden Gruppen widmen sich verschiedenen Repräsentationen und Verarbeitungsprozessen der gemeinsamen Datenbasis. Die hier skizzierten Themen und Arbeitsgruppen sind als Vorschläge von Seiten der Organisatoren zu verstehen und werden abhängig von den Kompetenzen und Interessen der Teilnehmenden zu Beginn des Workshops adaptiert. Die beiden Arbeitsbereiche “Transformation” und “Präsentation” werden für die Ziele des Workshops als zwingend notwendig erachtet und sind daher gesetzt. Weitere Themen und Arbeitsgruppen können von den Teilnehmenden ausgestaltet werden. Die Organisatoren moderieren die Bildung der Arbeitsgruppen und begleiten beratend die Entwicklungsphasen.</hi>

            <head>Theoretischer Hintergrund</head>
            <p>Literarische Motive – in ihrer Gestalt als 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">„a theme, character, or verbal pattern which recurs in literature“</hi> (Beckson & Ganz: 1960) – stellen seit Langem einen Untersuchungsgegenstand der Literaturwissenschaft dar. Als 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">„anthrophologische Grundsituationen, die zwar historisch variiert werden, aber in ihrem Kern konstant bleiben“</hi> (Nünning 2013: 542), ziehen sie sich durch die Literaturgeschichte und damit durch den geisteswissenschaftlichen Forschungsbereich. Hiervon angeregte Erkenntnisinteressen umfassen sowohl Fragen danach, wie bestimmte Motive in ausgewählten Werken auftauchen (u. a. Ester et al. 2017, Nölle 2017), als auch danach, wie sich dieses Auftauchen diachron verhält: Wie beständig bzw. flüchtig ist das jeweilige literarische Motiv (Freedman 1971: 126) und inwiefern koppelt es sich an bestimmte Perioden, Textgattungen oder Autor*innen (von Wilpert 2013: 534)? Daran, welcher Aspekt eines Motivs dabei im Wandel der Zeit bestehen bleibt, kann man Wilpert (2013: 533–534) zufolge zudem zwischen verschiedenen Motivarten differenzieren: Bei konstanten Situationen, wie jener des 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">heimkehrenden Sohnes</hi>, handelt es sich um Situationsmotive, während konstant bleibende Charaktere, wie der 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">Menschenfeind</hi>, Typus-Motive konstituieren.
                </p>

         <div rend=""DH-Heading1"" type=""div1"">
            <head>Forschungsstand</head>
            <p>Obwohl die Motivforschung, wie oben beschrieben, ein vielseitiges Forschungsfeld aufspannt, wurde dieses im Rahmen der Digital Humanities bisher kaum beachtet: Im deutschsprachigen Raum existieren derzeit keine digitalen Korpora, in welchen eine Motivannotation vorgenommen wurde, und auch im nicht-deutschsprachigen Raum scheinen sich derartige Bestrebungen primär auf die Textgattung der Volksmärchen zu beschränken (u. a. Karsdorp et al. 2012, Garcia-Fernandez et al. 2014). Nur in wenigen Ausnahmefällen, wie in der Mittelhochdeutschen Begriffsdatenbank (Springeth 2005), liegt eine semantische Annotation vor, die Themen oder andere motivähnliche Aspekte mit Mark-Up versieht. Begründung findet dieser Umstand der fehlenden Motivannotation vor allem in der vagen Natur des zu Annotierenden. So erfahren Motive nach Best (2008: 349) schließlich erst 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">„im sprachl. Kunstwerk ihre individuelle Ausformung [und sind] somit erst durch Abstraktion faßbar“</hi> und nicht an spezifische sprachliche Ausdrücke gebunden. Die Annotation von literarischen Motiven müsste insofern (noch) manuell vorgenommen werden, wodurch ein hoher Zeitaufwand entstünde sowie eine starke Subjektivität gegeben wäre. 
                </p>
         </div>
         <div rend=""DH-Heading1"" type=""div1"">
            <head>Forschungsvorhaben</head>
            <p>Dennoch macht die Überführung der Motivforschung in den Bereich der Digital Humanities Sinn: Korpusbasierte Untersuchungen ermöglichen die systematische Erforschung sowie quantitative Auswertung umfangreicher Textmengen und gewähren somit – vor allem im Hinblick auf die diachron angelegte Motivgeschichte und die Häufigkeiten spezifischer Motive (Freedman 1971: 126) – neue Erkenntnisse. Da es sich bei motivannotierten Korpora zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt jedoch noch um ein Desiderat handelt, muss hierfür ein anderer Zugang gewählt werden und zwar jener der Motivsuche – über folgende Frage: Mithilfe welcher Suchstrategien können Motive in nicht motivisch annotierten Korpora ausfindig gemacht werden?</p>
            <p>Für ebendiese Herausforderung versucht der hier geplante Beitrag mögliche Lösungsansätze aufzuzeigen, wobei der Fokus auf ausgewählten Typus-Motiven, wie dem 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">weisen Salomon</hi> oder dem 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">armen Sünder</hi>, liegt. Anhand dieser sollen exemplarisch diverse Suchstrategien entwickelt werden, mithilfe welcher literarische Motive in digitalen Korpora, wie dem Austrian Baroque Corpus (ABaC:us) oder dem Deutschen Textarchiv (DTA), identifiziert werden können. Die Potentiale der verwendeten digitalen Ressourcen für die Motivsuche werden dabei genauso diskutiert wie ihre auftauchenden Limitationen. Immer mitzubedenken gilt es etwa die bereits angesprochene wechselnde Gestalt von literarischen Motiven: Da es sich bei ihnen um abstrakte Konzepte handelt, welche auf der Textoberfläche eine Vielfalt an sprachlichen Formen annehmen können, sind sie nur schwer über wenige ausgewählte „key words“ aufspürbar. Hierzu trägt auch ihre Komplexität bei: 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">„Motive zeigen Personen und Sachen nicht isoliert, sondern in einem Zusammenhang“</hi> (Frenzel 1978: 29) und bestehen damit immer aus mehreren inhaltlichen Komponenten – wie im Falle von Typus-Motiven, bei welchen Charakteren gewisse Eigenschaften zugeschrieben werden. 
                </p>
            <p>Diesen Problemen versucht das vorliegende Forschungsvorhaben mit vielfältigen Mitteln beizukommen. So wird beispielsweise aus der in vielen Korpora bereits vorhandenen linguistischen Basisannotation, bestehend aus einer Lemmatisierung und einer Wortartenzuordnung (POS-Tagging), Nutzen gezogen: Eigenschaften, wie Weisheit, können etwa als attributive Adjektive operationalisiert und über Abstandsoperatoren nahe eines interessierenden Charakters lokalisiert werden. Zudem können über Open-Source-Anwendungen wie AntConc oder Voyant Tools Kookkurrenzanalysen durchgeführt werden, um Charaktere und Eigenschaften zueinander in Bezug zu setzen und typische Zuschreibungen und Formulierungen sichtbar zu machen. Passend hierzu wird ebenfalls das von Huijnen und Lonij (2016) für die thematische Suche entwickelte Programm „Keyword Generator“ auf seinen Ertrag für die Motivsuche hin befragt werden: Kann die Generierung motivspezifischer Suchwörter anhand bereits erkannter Textpassagen bei der Identifikation weiterer Belegstellen behilflich sein? Diese Frage soll genauso zu beantworten versucht werden wie jene nach der Wahl der adäquaten Suchtermini, für deren Ermittlung sowohl Synonym- als auch Motivdatenbanken zum Einsatz kommen werden. Damit soll der geplante Beitrag letztendlich anhand konkreter Beispiele aus der literaturwissenschaftlichen Praxis verschiedenste Suchstrategien sowie deren Vor- und Nachteile aufzeigen, um die Motivsuche für zukünftige Nutzer*innen zu erleichtern und dadurch zur vermehrten digitalen Motivforschung anzuregen.</p>

      <body>
         <p style=""text-align:left; "">Viele Verfahren des Text Mining und Distant Reading beschränken sich auf eine wortbasierte Auswertung von Texten. Auch wenn auf Basis der Wortformen und ihrer linearen Abfolge bereits neue Perspektiven auf Texte gewonnen werden (z. B. mittels der Voyant Tools, Sinclair / Rockwell 2016), schöpfen diese Methoden das Potential von Texten bei Weitem nicht aus. Insbesondere, wenn die Auswertungsergebnisse Gegenstand weiterführender Interpretationen werden, z. B. um soziale Phänomene zu beschreiben, sehen wir einen Mehrwert in der Auswertung zusätzlicher sprachlicher Strukturen. Konkret verwenden wir syntaktische Annotationen, die präzisere Informationen zu Wortkombinationen liefern können, etwa „X ist Subjekt von Y“ anstelle von „X steht im Kontext von Y“. Zudem bestehen viele syntaktische Relationen über eine längere Distanz an der Oberfläche hinweg und können deshalb nur durch eine syntaktische Perspektive erfasst werden (z. B. Andresen / Zinsmeister 2017). Dies gilt für unterschiedliche Sprachen in unterschiedlichem Ausmaß. Das Deutsche verfügt über deutlich mehr Distanzstrukturen als das Englische, für das die meisten Analyseverfahren ursprünglich entwickelt wurden.</p>
         <p style=""text-align:left; "">In diesem Beitrag vergleichen wir zwei Ansätze zur Berechnung von Kollokationen, einen oberflächenorientierten Ansatz und einen auf Dependenzannotationen basierten. An zwei Fallstudien aus den Fächern Kulturanthropologie und Pflegewissenschaft wird demonstriert, wie die beiden Ansätze eine qualitative Interpretation von Textdaten in Hinblick auf gesellschaftliche bzw. soziale Phänomene unterstützen können. Die Erstellung eines eindeutigen Goldstandards, der eine formale Evaluation erlauben würde, ist bei dieser Art Fragestellung nicht möglich. Stattdessen wird auf qualitative Weise das Potential dieser Analyse zur Bearbeitung der geistes- und sozialwissenschaftlichen Fragestellungen beschrieben.</p>
         <div rend=""DH-Heading1"" type=""div1"">
            <head>Syntaktische Profile: Forschungsstand</head>
            <p style=""text-align:left; "">Die Nutzung syntaktischer Informationen zur Charakterisierung von Wortverwendungen ist vor allem in der Lexikografie betrieben worden. Populär wurde das Konzept unter dem Namen „word sketch“ besonders durch die korpuslinguistische Software SketchEngine (Kilgarriff et al. 2004, Kilgarriff et al. 2014). Für ein gegebenes Suchwort wird hier angegeben, welche anderen Wörter besonders häufig in spezifischen syntaktischen Relationen zum Suchwort stehen, z. B. 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">glimpse</hi> als frequentes Objekt von 
                    <hi rend=""italic"">catch</hi> (Kilgarriff et al. 2014: 9). Im Digitalen Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache (DWDS) kann eine entsprechende Darstellung als sog. DWDS-Wortprofil abgerufen werden (Geyken 2011).
                </p>
            <p style=""text-align:left; "">Weitere Anwendungen gibt es in der Literaturwissenschaft und Linguistik: Googasian / Heuser (2019) vergleichen die syntaktischen Kontexte von Menschen und Tieren in einem Korpus sog. „wild animal stories“. Andresen (2018) nutzt syntaktische n-Gramme für einen Vergleich der Wissenschaftssprachen in den Fächern Literaturwissenschaft und Linguistik. Eine Anwendung auf sozialwissenschaftliche Fragestellungen erfolgt vor allem in den Politikwissenschaften: Anhand syntaktischer Muster wie z. B. Argumentstrukturen oder Mustern der Redewiedergabe werden hier politische Akteure und ihre Positionen identifiziert, miteinander in Relation gesetzt und so Diskurse charakterisiert (van Atteveldt et al. 2008, Kleinnijenhuis / van Atteveldt 2014, Wüest et al. 2011, Blessing et al. 2013). In den Fächern Pflegewissenschaft und Kulturanthropologie steht die Exploration des Mehrwertes syntaktischer Analysen noch aus.</p>

            <head>Daten und Fragestellungen der Fallstudien</head>
            <p style=""text-align:left; "">Das Potential syntaktisch definierter Kollokationen wird an zwei Fallstudien mit komplementärer Datenlage erprobt. Die erste nutzt ein großes Korpus geschriebener Sprache, das dadurch methodisch eine sehr sichere Grundlage bietet. Die zweite Fallstudie basiert auf einem eher kleinen Korpus mit gesprochener Sprache, was mehr methodische Herausforderungen erwarten lässt.</p>
            <p style=""text-align:left; "">Die kulturanthropologische Fallstudie befasst sich mit dem Themenkomplex der Telemedizin und insbesondere der Frage nach der (Nicht-)Akzeptanz telemedizinischer Anwendungen durch unterschiedliche gesellschaftliche Akteursgruppen. Das hierfür erstellte Korpus umfasst 8.784 Texte mit insgesamt 14,8 Mio. Token und basiert auf einem Webcrawling (Adelmann / Franken 2020). Dafür wurden Webseiten von Krankenkassen, Ärzte- und Patientenverbänden als Ausgangspunkt genutzt und dann Links zu Seiten verfolgt, die mindestens eines von mehreren Wörtern aus einem Wortfeld zur Telemedizin enthalten (Koch / Franken im Druck). </p>
            <p style=""text-align:left; "">Grundlage der pflegewissenschaftlichen Fallstudie ist ein Korpus aus 31 Dialogen, die mit schwerkranken und sterbenden Menschen in palliativer Versorgung geführt wurden. Es handelt sich um Transkripte gesprochener Sprache im Umfang von gut 100.000 Token. Gegenstand der Studie sind die Deutungen von Entscheidungen hinsichtlich der gesundheitlichen Versorgung der Betroffenen.</p>

            <head>Methode</head>
            <p style=""text-align:left; "">Die Texte beider Korpora werden mithilfe
des Parsers MATE (Bohnet 2010), trainiert auf der Hamburger Dependency
Treebank (Foth et al. 2014), mit Lemmata, Wortarten und syntaktischen
Dependenzen annotiert. Unter Kollokationen verstehen wir „a
combination of two words that exhibit a tendency to occur near each
other in natural language“ (Evert 2008: 1214). Bei der
Operationalisierung von „near each other“ können Kriterien an der
Textoberfläche oder syntaktische Kriterien angesetzt werden: Für den
einfachen Ansatz ohne Annotationen betrachten wir Wörter in einem
Kontextfenster von +/- 3 Wörtern als benachbart, für den syntaktischen
Ansatz Wörter mit einer direkten Dependenzrelation. In beiden Fällen
wird mithilfe des Log-Likelihood-Ratios (LLR, Dunning 1993) berechnet,
welche Kombinationen häufiger im Korpus vorkommen, als basierend auf
den Einzelfrequenzen der Wörter zu erwarten wäre. Im Falle der
syntaktischen Kollokationen werden dafür die Einzelfrequenzen in der
spezifischen syntaktischen Relation genutzt. Die Ergebnisse basieren
auf den Lemmata und werden nach Schlüsselwörtern gefiltert, die für
die jeweiligen Fragestellungen als bedeutsam ausgewählt wurden
(<hi rend=""italic"">T</hi>/<hi rend=""italic"">telemed</hi> bzw. 
<hi rend=""italic"">E</hi>/<hi rend=""italic"">entscheid</hi>). Das hierfür verwendete Analyseskript steht auf GitHub zur Verfügung.<ref n=""1"" target=""ftn1""/> Für die Interpretation werden die Top 10 beider Listen verglichen und nach Bedarf weitere Einträge gesichtet.

Die Annotationen ermöglichen außerdem, die Gesamtliste nach bestimmten syntaktischen Relationen zu filtern. Die genannten Appositionen beispielsweise können anhand des Relationslabels ausgeblendet werden. Auch hier gibt es sehr allgemeine Konzepte wie 
<hi rend=""italic"">telemedizinisch</hi> als Attribut von 
<hi rend=""italic"">Anwendung</hi>, die zwar frequent, aber nicht sehr informativ sind. 
<hi rend=""italic"">Telemedizin</hi> als Genitivattribut von 
<hi rend=""italic"">Möglichkeit</hi> weist daraufhin, dass eben deren Möglichkeiten noch Gegenstand des Diskurses sind. In der Durchsicht der Kollokationen jenseits der Top 10 finden sich verwandte Themen des Potentials und der Projekthaftigkeit (<hi rend=""italic"">Potential der Telemedizin</hi>, 
<hi rend=""italic"">Telemedizin-typisches Potential</hi>, 
<hi rend=""italic"">evaluiertes Telemedizinprojekt</hi>, 
<hi rend=""italic"">vielversprechendes Telemedizinprojekt</hi>), die anzeigen, dass sich die Umsetzung der Telemedizin in einer frühen Phase befindet und ihre Akzeptanz als Regelversorgung noch nicht abschließend verhandelt ist.

               <p style=""text-align:left; "">Tabelle 3 zeigt die zehn ersten oberflächenbasierten Kollokationen des Dialogkorpus zu Lemmata mit 
<hi rend=""italic"">E</hi>/<hi rend=""italic"">entscheid</hi>. Hier werden zunächst Probleme in den Daten deutlich: Mit 
<hi rend=""italic"">Finan/</hi> liegt ein für gesprochene Sprache typischer Abbruch eines Wortes (vermutlich: 
<hi rend=""italic"">Finanzentscheidung</hi>) vor. Zudem ist 
<hi rend=""italic"">Entscheidungsvariant</hi> eine fehlerhafte Lemmaform zu 
<hi rend=""italic"">Entscheidungsvarianten</hi>. Insgesamt sind die Frequenzen aufgrund der geringen Korpusgröße klein, lassen aber trotzdem hilfreiche Schlüsse für die Analyse zu. Im syntaxbasierten Gegenstück in Tabelle 4 sind zusätzliche Probleme erkennbar, die durch die automatische Verarbeitung gesprochener Sprache entstehen. Die Relation zwischen 
<hi rend=""italic"">hab</hi> und 
<hi rend=""italic"">entscheiden</hi> ist fehlerhaft als adverbial (korrekt: auxiliar) bezeichnet. Allerdings wird ein direkter Zusammenhang zwischen diesen Wörtern erst durch die syntaktischen Annotationen überhaupt erkennbar, da sie im Satz häufig nicht benachbart stehen. Zusätzlich gibt es vollständig falsche Analysen wie die Relation zwischen 
<hi rend=""italic"">entscheidend</hi> und 
<hi rend=""italic"">Puh</hi>.

               <p style=""text-align:left; "">Auch für die pflegewissenschaftliche Interpretation bieten die Kollokationen mit den höchsten LLR-Werten erste Anhaltspunkte, die dann durch eine Sichtung der weiteren Rangplätze ergänzt werden können. Die häufigsten Kollokatoren von Entscheidungen stehen für eine Realisierung eigener Entscheidungen der Betroffenen. Die Kollokation 
<hi rend=""italic"">richtig</hi> macht Bewertungen der Entscheidungen sichtbar. Es zeigen sich zudem gegensätzliche Dimensionen des Phänomens, wie „selber entscheiden“ vs. „Entscheidung abgeben“, die hinter der Kollokation mit 
<hi rend=""italic"">überlassen</hi> stehen. Insbesondere die Subjekt-
und Objektrelationen
(<hi rend=""italic"">Entscheidung treffen</hi>, 
<hi rend=""italic"">Entschluss entstehen</hi>, 
<hi rend=""italic"">Entscheidung überlassen</hi>) sind durch die syntaktische Analyse adäquater und theoretisch fundierter abgebildet. Dieser Nutzen wird jedoch durch Fehler in der automatischen Annotation eingeschränkt. Zudem werden diese Relationen in der gesprochenen Sprache mit kürzeren Sätzen möglicherweise auch durch die oberflächenbasierte Analyse besser erfasst als in anderen sprachlichen Registern. Insgesamt betrachtet werden durch den quantitativen Zugang Verwendungszusammenhänge des Phänomens „Entscheidung“ transparent, die wiederum auf wichtige Handlungskontexte in der Versorgungsrealität von schwerkranken und sterbenden Menschen verweisen.

            <p style=""text-align:left; "">Es hat sich gezeigt, dass die Berechnung von Kollokationen auf der Grundlage der sprachlichen Oberfläche bzw. der Syntax für qualitative Fragestellungen informativ sein kann. Für die Auswertung einer spezifischen Fragestellung ist die Assoziationsstärke allein jedoch nicht immer das entscheidende Kriterium. Die Kollokationen geben Hinweise auf Zusammenhänge innerhalb des Korpus, die neue Fragestellungen und Perspektiven generieren können. Gleichzeitig werden durch die Relationsannotationen bereits kleine Datenmengen in erweiterter Form auswertbar.</p>
            <p style=""text-align:left; "">Die beispielhaften Analysen haben gezeigt, dass die syntaktischen Annotationen eine für die Interpretation hilfreiche Differenzierung bieten, indem präziser angegeben wird, in welcher Relation zwei Wörter stehen. Das ermöglicht auch das Filtern nach interessanten Relationstypen. Zudem werden durch den Einbezug der Syntax Relationen zwischen Wörtern in Distanzstellung sichtbar, was insbesondere vom Verb abhängige Satzteile besser sichtbar macht. Andererseits erfordern die syntaktischen Annotationen eine aufwendigere Vorverarbeitung, die mehr Zeit und technische Fähigkeiten erfordert. Außerdem stellen sie eine zusätzliche Fehlerquelle dar. Dies gilt besonders für die gesprochensprachlichen Daten. Eine systematische Überprüfung und Rückbindung an konkrete Korpusbelege ist deshalb wichtig und verbessert die Interpretationsmöglichkeiten aus qualitativer Sicht. </p>
            <p style=""text-align:left; "">Anschließend an diese Arbeiten ist geplant, stärker Kontexte zu aggregieren: In grammatischer Hinsicht wird das durch Koreferenzannotationen erfolgen, die für das pflegewissenschaftliche Korpus bereits vorliegen. Auf semantischer Ebene verfolgen wir den Ansatz, Wortgruppen zu Konzepten zusammenzufassen, z. B. können 
<hi rend=""italic"">Ärztin</hi>, 
<hi rend=""italic"">Arzt</hi>, 
<hi rend=""italic"">Hausarzt</hi>, 
<hi rend=""italic"">Onkologin</hi> usw. auf ein gemeinsames Konzept ÄRZT*INNEN abgebildet werden (vgl. den Ansatz von Wüest et al. 2011). Wir sehen außerdem weitere Anwendungsfälle über die Fächergrenzen hinweg, etwa zur literaturwissenschaftlichen Beschreibung von Geschlechterzuschreibungen, indem die sprachlichen Kontexte weiblicher und männlicher Vornamen verglichen werden.

               <hi style=""font-size:12pt"" space=""preserve"">Aktuelle Diskussionen über ständig wachsende Möglichkeiten der Erfassung, Speicherung und Analyse großer Datenmengen lassen uns vergessen, dass sowohl Wissenschaft als auch Behörden bereits seit Jahrhunderten Praktiken zur Datenerhebung und -verarbeitung entwickelt haben (Borck 2017, Oertzen 2017). So wurden bereits im 17. Jahrhundert astronomische und meteorologische Beobachtungsdaten in Formularen und Tabellen erfasst, in Zahlen und Symbolen kodiert und in Karten und Diagrammen visualisiert (Daston 2011, Mendelsohn 2011, Hess 2011). Auch die empirische Erfassung von personenbezogenen Körperdaten nahm ihren Anfang in den Praxisjournalen frühneuzeitlicher Ärzte, die alle Symptome, Zustandsmerkmale und Reaktionen sowie den Krankheitsverlauf, die Medikamentierung und den Heilungsprozess ihrer Patienten genau dokumentierten (Geyer-Kordesch 1990, Stolberg 2007).

               <hi style=""font-size:12pt"" space=""preserve""> des pietistischen Arztes Johann Christian Senckenberg (1707–1772). In ihnen protokollierte er tagtäglich sein gesamtes Körper- und Seelenleben, um seinen Lebenswandel zu vervollkommnen. Neben Ernährung, Stoffwechsel, Körperaktivität sowie Schlaf- und Ruhephasen notierte er auch alle Reizempfindungen, Körperreflexe und Gemütszustände sowie alle spürbaren Umwelt- und Witterungseinflüsse (Faßhauer 2017). Zeitweise brachte er auf diese Weise täglich bis zu 5.000 Wörter zu Papier, so dass auf den Gesamtzeitraum von dreizehn Jahren gerechnet ca. 14.000 Seiten mit 12.600.000 Wörtern zusammenkamen. Der Beitrag beleuchtet zunächst den epistemischen Zweck dieses riesigen frühneuzeitlichen Datenpools, aus dem derzeit in Frankfurt ausgewählte Bände digital ediert werden (Faßhauer 2018), und setzt sie mit zeitgenössischen Positionen zum Verhältnis von Daten und Theorie in Beziehung. Anschließend wird die Möglichkeit einer Analyse dieser Daten mit modernen </hi>

            <head>Selbstbeobachtung und Anti-Rationalismus</head>
            <p>
               <hi style=""font-size:12pt"">Wenn ein Selbstoptimierer des digitalen Zeitalters beschließt, seine Lebenszeit effizient zu nutzen, seinen Körper gesund zu erhalten oder seine Finanzen zu organisieren, bezweckt er damit meist größtmöglichen persönlichen Erfolg und Selbstzufriedenheit im Diesseits. Ein religiöser Self-Tracker des 18. Jahrhunderts hatte hingegen zu allererst sein Seelenheil und seine Erlösung nach dem Tod im Sinn. Diese konnte jedoch nur erlangen, wer die ihm anvertrauten Gottesgeschenke auf Erden treulich verwaltete, pflegte und mehrte. Genau wie für materielle Güter galt dies auch für Gesundheit und Wissenskapital. Nach Auffassung religiöser Gelehrter wie Senckenberg war der Mensch seit dem Sündenfall jedoch geistig so zerrüttet, dass er durch seine Verstandeskräfte zu keinen verlässlichen Erkenntnissen gelangen konnte. Insbesondere theoretische Modelle, die durch „künstliches syllogisiren der Vernunfft“ dem Verstand der Gelehrten („ex mente Doctorum“) entstiegen sind, repräsentierten nur fragmentarisches oder abstraktes Wissen. Zudem müssten ohnehin „alle Regulae universaliores erstlich ab experientia in particularibus“ abgeleitet werden, deren Vielfalt jedoch so viele Ausnahmen aufzeige, „daß die Regulae selbst wieder darüber zernichtet werden“ (Senckenberg 1735: 1r/v, Faßhauer 2017). Sichere medizinische Erkenntnisse waren deshalb nur „ohne Praeoccupation von einer vorher gefassten Hypothesi“ durch mehrfach wiederholte unmittelbare Selbsterfahrung zu erlangen, deren Resultate möglichst vollständig aufgezeichnet und induktiv ausgewertet werden mussten. Auf diese Weise ließen sich Vergleiche mit Aufzeichnungen aus ähnlichen Situationen herstellen, wobei einzelne Faktoren miteinander korreliert, auf ihre Relevanz und Rolle im Gesamtkontext befragt und als mögliche Ursachen oder Auswirkungen anderer Faktoren in Betracht gezogen werden konnten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi style=""font-size:12pt"">Ganz ähnliche Überzeugungen wie Senckenberg äußerte der amerikanische Journalist Chris Anderson, als er im Jahre 2008 das Ende der Theorie und den Beginn des Datenzeitalters verkündete. Auch er ging dabei von der Prämisse aus, dass Theorien die Realität nur verzerrt wiedergäben und letztlich allein in den Hirnen der Wissenschaftler existierten: „The scientific method is built around testable hypotheses. These models, for the most part, are systems visualized in the minds of scientists”. Stattdessen verwies er wie Senckenberg auf die Möglichkeit, durch Erhebung und Speicherung einer möglichst großen Datenfülle ungleich genauere und verlässlichere Aussagen über die Welt in ihrer ganzen Komplexität zu treffen. War der Verzicht auf die Suche nach letztgültigen Kausalitäten bei Senckenberg noch religiös motiviert, entspringt er bei Anderson aus der pragmatischen Erkenntnis, dass die Verfügbarkeit nie gekannter Datenmengen die Notwendigkeit zur Hypothesenbildung schlichtweg erübrige, da sie unter den verschiedensten Gesichtspunkten miteinander korreliert werden könnten. Durch ihre maschinelle Auswertbarkeit gerieten zudem auch Einzelheiten und Muster ins Blickfeld, die der theoriegeleiteten Forschung entgingen: „Correlation supersedes causation, and science can advance even without coherent models, unified theories, or really any mechanistic explanation at all“ (Anderson 2008). Seither wurde gegen Andersons These wiederholt eingewandt, dass bereits die Erstellung von Datensätzen auf theoretischen Prämissen und Selektionskriterien beruhe (boyd/Crawford 2012; Boellstorff 2014). Zudem stelle jede Datenanalyse eine subjektive Interpretation innerhalb bestimmter kultureller, dogmatischer oder ideologischer Kontexte dar, so dass eine hypothesenfreie Datenauswertung unmöglich sei. Die gleiche Problematik lässt sich auch für die Aufzeichnungen Senckenberg aufzeigen: Außer Thermometer und Barometer stand ihm nur sein eigenes Bewusstsein als Messinstanz zur Verfügung, das alle Empfindungen und Wahrnehmungen zwangsläufig subjektiv registrierte, filterte und interpretierte und dabei den protokollierten physischen und seelischen Befindlichkeiten selbst unterworfen war. Auch erfolgte die Aufzeichnung der Daten allein durch seine eigene schreibende Hand, die auf körperliche Irregularitäten ebenso empfindlich reagierte wie auf seelische Erschütterungen und Stimmungsschwankungen. Waren Körper und Bewusstsein anderweitig okkupiert, konnte die Datenerfassung entweder gar nicht oder nur rückwirkend und durch das Gedächtnis vermittelt erfolgen.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi style=""font-size:12pt"" space=""preserve"">Senckenbergs riesiger Datenpool konfrontiert seine modernen Leser mit einem so mikroskopisch detaillierten Bewusstseinsstrom, dass ein Verständnis seiner Erkenntnisse im </hi>

               <hi style=""font-size:12pt"" space=""preserve""> ermöglicht nun eine Annäherung an das umfangreiche Textmaterial aus der Makroperspektive (Abb. 1a–b). Der Literaturwissenschaftler Franco Moretti hat dieses Vorgehen bekanntlich als „distant reading“ bezeichnet, da Distanz hier statt eines Hindernisses eine Bedingung der Erkenntnis darstelle: „it allows you to focus on units that are much smaller or much larger than the text“. Die Reduktion von Senckenbergs umfangreichen Beobachtungsdaten auf abstrakte Schemata scheint jedoch zunächst im Widerspruch zu seiner Absicht zu stehen, die ganze Vielfalt der natürlichen Erscheinungsformen unverkürzt zu erfassen. Auch Moretti hat auf dieses Problem hingewiesen: „If we want to understand the system in its entirety, we must accept losing something. We always pay a price for theoretical knowledge: reality is infinitely rich; concepts are abstract, are poor” (Moretti 2013: 48–49). Die irreversible Reduktion von Texten auf abstrakte Schemen, die in der Forschung sogar als gewaltsame Zerstörung des eigentlichen Untersuchungsgegenstandes beschrieben worden ist (Bradley 2012), kann nur in solchen Forschungsumgebungen vermieden werden, die – wie etwa die Voyant Tools (Sinclair und Rockwell 2003) – einen flexiblen Wechsel zwischen der Text- und der Grafikebene und damit zwischen dem </hi>

               <hi style=""font-size:12pt"" space=""preserve"">-Modus ermöglichen (Jänicke 2016: 20–23). Ein möglicher Ausgangspunkt für eine Fernlektüre ist die Identifizierung von Schlüsselwörtern, die hier anhand von Häufigkeitskriterien erfolgt. Werden in der Liste einzelne Keywords ausgewählt, kann deren Verteilung im Korpus angezeigt werden. Eine Visualisierung der markantesten körperlichen Empfindungen Senckenbergs zwischen August und Dezember 1732 zeigt zum Beispiel, dass im November und Dezember Spannungs- und Druckgefühle vorherrschten, während er im Oktober hauptsächlich Stiche und Zuckungen verspürte, im August und September aber frei von derlei Empfindungen war (Abb. 2). Ein Blick auf die Kollokationen dieser Begriffe zeigt, in welchen Körperteilen sie am häufigsten bemerkbar waren (Abb. 3). Allerdings stellen derlei Festlegungen auf bestimmte Untersuchungszeiträume oder Körperempfindungen bereits Arbeitshypothesen dar, die mit einer bestimmten Erwartungshaltung einhergehen und das Ergebnis dadurch nicht unmaßgeblich präformieren. Die oben aufgezeigte Unmöglichkeit des von Senckenberg projektierten theoriefreien Wissenserwerbs spiegelt sich deshalb unmittelbar in der digitalen Korpusanalyse wider, die gleichfalls nicht rein datengetrieben bzw. ohne hypothetische Vorüberlegungen erfolgen kann. </hi>

            <p>
               <hi style=""font-size:12pt"">Auch Senckenbergs Essgewohnheiten lassen sich nur mit begriffsbasierten Suchabfragen analysieren. Die Suche nach dem Schlüsselwort „bibi” (ich trank) im Kontext der fünf angrenzenden Wörter zeigt beispielsweise, dass Senckenberg zwar überwiegend Wasser und Tee trank, aber bereits an dritter Stelle der Wein folgte (Abb. 4). Berücksichtigt man jedoch auch andere Getränke wie Kaffee, Bier, Alantwein und Milch sowie die entsprechenden lateinischen Begriffe, so ergibt sich aus dem Verhältnis zwischen alkoholfreien und alkoholischen Getränken das eher moderate Verhältnis von 253 zu 105. Übermäßiger Alkoholkonsum konnte jedoch Gottes Unwillen hervorrufen und durch körperliche und mentale Beschwerden bestraft werden, die sich gleichfalls in den Aufzeichnungen niederschlagen. Die Akribie der Senckenbergischen Selbstbeobachtung ermöglicht es, Vergleiche zwischen den in mehreren solcher Situationen auftretenden Symptomen anzustellen, die als Muster visualisiert und auf Ähnlichkeiten und Abweichungen durch Begleitfaktoren untersucht werden können. Abb. 5 zeigt etwa, dass sich die körperlichen Auswirkungen des Weinkonsums im warmen Monat September (a), den der Diarist für zahlreiche Freiluftaktivitäten nutzte, deutlich von denen im kälteren November (b) unterscheiden, welchen der Autor größtenteils daheim verbrachte. Noch aussagekräftiger sind die Ergebnisse einer Symptomanalyse auf Wochen- oder Tagesbasis. Dabei ist weniger bedeutsam, ob und wie die Symptome kausal zusammenhängen: Wichtiger ist es zu zeigen, dass und auf welche Weise sie gemeinsam auftreten, und wie sich verschiedene Situationen voneinander unterscheiden.</hi>

                    <item>It offers a publication platform for digital scholarly editions, with full-text (preferably encoded in TEI) and facsimiles, and any accompanying materials, such as introduction, editorial statement, critical apparatus, contextual source materials, bibliography, and indices;</item>
                    <item>It facilitates the semantic annotation of these editions and their related scholarship (in any format) by enabling easy-to-perform formal ontological modelling (based on the CIDOC-CRM family of ontologies

                        </note>), and thus hopes to contribute to providing the abovementioned “connective tissue” not only for scattered collections, but to overcome the artificial print/digital divide.
                    </item>
                </list>
                <p style=""text-align: left; "">PRISMS was born out of the realization that digital editions do not break with the historicity or materiality of the sources they organize and present, but instead remediate and extend them in ways that enable new forms of access, engagement, presentation, and analysis. PRISMS conceptualizes digital editions as living entities that perform rather than merely document the remediation they engage in.</p>
                <p style=""text-align: left; "">The scholarship that underpins each digital edition provides the essential context for these remediation processes, and collectively they sustain the knowledge network that supports all academic engagement with the texts from any disciplinary viewpoint. PRISMS is designed to allow for the collaborative and collective modelling of this continuum of digital editions and scholarship by placing digital editions, their material and contextual basis, and the resulting academic engagement in a linked context, building on the standards and tools provided by the Semantic Web.</p>
                <p style=""text-align: left; "">We believe that this type of formalization is beneficial for the purposes of this project in at least three ways: firstly, ontologies facilitate modelling with reduced reliance on implicit knowledge through an explicit, shared conceptualization of the domain. Secondly, formal models encourage collaboration as they can be shared, re-used, adapted (forked), enhanced, aggregated, and developed collaboratively. Thirdly, as a form of knowledge representation, visualization, and preservation, formal models support computational processing and ultimately reasoning, and can develop alongside the mental models and human reasoning we engage in as scholars. PRISMS facilitates scholarship that is based on these principles

                <head>Approach and implementation</head>
                <p style=""text-align: left; "">The PRISMS Open Scholarship platform integrates the task of publishing digital editions with the need for analytical and modelling tools to perform the type of knowledge representation that connects the material, digital, and the scholarship that builds on them. PRISMS aims to support digital editors, book historians, experts in media and cultural studies, librarians, literary scholars, and of course digital humanists, to ensure a wide range of domain expertise, disciplinary practices, and methodological approaches are reflected in the platform. To this end, the PRISMS platform hosts a variety of tools alongside the digital editions, which can be categorized as component tools (such as text-based tools, image-based tools, XML-based tools, etc.) and workbench tools (those available across document types and editions).</p>

                <p style=""text-align: left; "">The former category of tools is useful for any type of close scholarly work, and in PRISMS these tools include a bookmarking tool, an annotation tool (initially focussing on texts and images, but with a vision to extend annotation capabilities across all media types), the ability to keep research records (and other forms of note-taking, e.g. transcriptions, translations etc.) in the form of notebooks, and integration of Voyant Tools

Every user of PRISMS has both read access to this global graph that underpins the platform and unlimited access (via SPARQL Update operations) to a private graph. By default, everything in PRISMS is private. Everything contributors add is immediately visible to them, and they can conduct their scholarship in complete privacy, without delay or interference. Only when the user decides to publish their contributions will they be made available to everyone. Depending on the type of contribution made, there are options to share, download, and/or publish them. All contributions made to the PRISMS platform are stored in standard formats, e.g. the W3C Web Annotation Data Model for annotations and relations.</p>

And it is easy to add new editions to the platform either as part of a dedicated digital scholarly editing process, for which training is provided, or by simply adding a IIIF manifest and using a built-in XML-aware or standard text-editor to start transcribing and adding contextual materials. The platform already supports the addition and semantic annotation of a wide range of primary and secondary materials, such as facsimiles in IIIF, a transcription of a source text, a PDF of a journal article, a video of a theatrical performance, an audio book, an image, or a 3D-model of a sculpture mentioned in a text, etc.

With end of the beta phase, the project also intends to provide access to the entire PRISMS knowledge graph through regular data dumps and a public SPARQL endpoint. We envision that over time, PRISMS will evolve both as a powerful discovery tool and a personal research tool.</p>

                <p style=""text-align: left; "">It is difficult to identify named entities like people and places in long texts and even more difficult to connect the entities that you find to the rich network of information available on the web. In this paper we describe work supported by the LINCS (Linked Infrastructure for Networked Cultural Scholarship) project to make named entity recognition available to scholars through Voyant and its extension Spyral. In this talk we will:</p>
                <p style=""text-align: left; "">First, describe the development of NSSI, a set of named entity recognition (NER) tools that are also available as web services for other tools like Voyant to use.</p>
                <p style=""text-align: left; "">Second, describe how Voyant can use NSSI as a web service to process a text by adding named entity recognition.</p>
                <p style=""text-align: left; "">Third, describe how Spyral, the notebook programming extension of Voyant, can be used for more sophisticated control of the process of named entity recognition, extraction, and use in Voyant. </p>
                <p style=""text-align: left; "">Finally, we will conclude by discussing how NSSI and Spyral will be linked into the LINCS infrastructure to allow scholars to connect their enriched data to that of others.</p>
                <p style=""text-align: left; "">Background on LINCS</p>
                <p style=""text-align: left; "">Humanists tend to be interested in named people, named places and particular organizations over time. NER tools let humanists identify mentions in text referring to the people, places, organizations and other entities discussed in large collections without having to manually comb through them. Good tools like the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al. 2005) have been available for some time, but are difficult to use if you are not familiar with command line tools and not connected with other resources.</p>
                <p style=""text-align: left; "">The LINCS project, led by Susan Brown at the University of Guelph, is funded by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation to develop shared infrastructure for linked open data. To that end LINCS is working with teams at the University of Alberta and McGill University to develop new NER tools and to connect them to easy-to-use text analysis environments like Voyant.</p>

                <head>NSSI</head>
                <p style=""text-align: left; "">NSSI, or NERVE Secure Scalable Infrastructure, is an application that bundles natural language processing tools, making them simple to use and combine into workflows common to the digital humanities (Zafar 2021). This framework was developed as part of the LINCS project, with the intent to decouple the backend NER tools from the existing Named Entity Recognition Vetting Environment (NERVE) user interface developed by the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory. This separation allows us to continue using those NER services for NERVE, while making them accessible to other tools such as Voyant and Spyral.</p>
                <p style=""text-align: left; "">NSSI’s design focuses on modularity, with each tool connected as a service that can be used individually or within a larger set of steps. For NER in particular, we have integrated Stanford NER which otherwise requires programming knowledge to use, since it does not come with its own API. With NSSI, a tool such as Spyral can make an API call that includes input text or XML and retrieve the named entities when processing completes. In the presentation we will briefly describe the NSSI infrastructure.</p>

                <p style=""text-align: left; "">Voyant Tools is a suite of text analysis and visualization tools that are widely used with over 100,000 users in the last six months. The tools are available in the browser so they don’t need to be installed, though you can download them and run them locally (Rockwell & Sinclair 2016). In the presentation we will show how Voyant can call the NER tools in NSSI and display the found entities as a list for further use. We will also describe the usability testing conducted on ResoViz through the LINCS project.</p>

                <p style=""text-align: left; "">Voyant is also being extended with a notebook programming environment called Spyral (Land et al. 2021; Rockwell et al. 2021). Spyral is, like Observable, an in-browser notebook programming environment that uses JavaScript as the programming language. The difference between Spyral and other notebook environments like Mathematica or Google Colab is that a) the notebooks are maintained on the server so that, again, there is no installation needed and b) Spyral is an extension to Voyant. This means that you can save what you see in Voyant as a notebook with an interactive panel of results embedded in the notebook. Then you can document your results, add more interactive panels, and process the results. In the presentation we will show how Spyral can be used to extend the work with NSSI possible with Voyant and to edit and document results.</p>

The ultimate goal is to provide scholars with linked infrastructure where data about entities like people or novels can be annotated and connected with that of other projects.</p>

        <body>
            <p style=""text-align: left; "">Digital literary text analysis is increasingly becoming an integral part of literary studies. However, many tools designed for performing such analysis remain inaccessible to researchers without significant coding and computing skills. Voyant Tools was designed in part to address this gap. Spyral Notebooks are an extension of Voyant Tools and allow researchers to expand upon their findings from Voyant in a notebook environment. Unlike other notebook environments, Spyral Notebooks are accessible without downloading any programs or advanced set-up. Spyral Notebooks are available in an entirely online format. To use Spyral Notebooks, one needs only a connection to the Internet. The notebooks are easily adaptable, shareable, and editable. </p>
            <p style=""text-align: left; "">Spyral is a notebook development environment that is integrated into Voyant Tools. Notebook environments can be thought of as both extensions of traditional research notebooks and as novel tools that integrate documentation, active analysis and presentation of results. At their core, notebooks are made up of three types of blocks or cells that a user can add or delete in a sequence. </p>
            <list rend=""numbered"">
                <item>There are text cells that can contain headings and other text elements found in word processors or browser editors (usually based in HTML) for typing unstructured text. Depending on the notebook environment, the text blocks can be simple or more sophisticated. Spyral Notebooks use HTML for text and offer an in- browser WYSIWYG HTML editor for the text blocks. </item>
                <item>There are code cells where the user inputs code, be it Python, the Wolfram language used in Mathematica, or JavaScript, which is used in Spyral. The code cells can be run in sequence or individually as you debug your code. Code cells can contain as much or as little code as the user desires. </item>
                <item>There are output cells which produce the output of the code you input in the associated code cell. It is important to recognize that the output of the code is dependent on what you have instructed the computer to do; that is, it is not a printout of the code cell but the results of running your code. You thus have to instruct the computer to print out the desired results. </item>
            </list>
            <p style=""text-align: left; "">In our tutorial we introduce participants to Spyral Notebooks. We illustrate how to create a corpus for textual analysis from Voyant Tools or directly in Spyral Notebooks. After walking through the basic mechanisms for using Spyral Notebooks including saving, editing, and sharing notebooks, we move on to more specific features available in Spyral. Participants will learn how to enhance the capabilities of Voyant and go deeper with their textual analysis using Spyral. Finally we provide participants with several tutorial notebooks designed to highlight some of Spyral’s advanced features such as categories for use in sentiment analysis. </p>
            <p style=""text-align: left; "">Spyral Notebooks are a welcome addition to the field of digital humanities as they provide an accessible notebook environment specifically designed for literary text analysis. Spyral Notebooks are thoughtfully designed to serve researchers with limited coding skills who want to take their analysis from Voyant one step further. We especially envisage Spyral proving useful for digital humanities instructors. Spyral provides a useful platform for student work, allowing students to embed their analysis from Voyant, perform more complex analysis using JavaScript, and annotate their code with their thought processes.</p>

        <body>
            <p style=""text-align: left; "">The introduction of digital text analysis tools and methodologies in (non-digital) humanities undergraduate courses has been sparsely documented in the literature. Furthermore, most of the times we encounter it, it is done in the context of semester-long or mid-term projects (Boyle and Hall 2016; Ficke 2014), where the stakes for the students are very high. Other times, they include a session on text analysis but no practical application of the tools and methodologies discussed in the course, other than a follow along demonstration.</p>
            <p style=""text-align: left; "">This short paper introduces a middle point between these two extremes through the introduction of low stakes activities and assignments to help student discover and use digital text analysis tools and methodologies.</p>
            <p style=""text-align: left; "">Besides giving students the opportunity to interact with the material in a safe and relaxed manner, low stakes activities help with student retention, confidence, and relationship building (Hamilton 2020; Meer and Chapman 2014). Low stakes activities are also a useful tool to assess comprehension and instruction when the person delivering the lesson is not the regular or official instructor in the course, such as the case of a librarian or a guest speaker. Furthermore, these types of activities are particularly useful for digital humanities instruction because they contribute to scaffolding, a method that has been identified as ideal in this type of instruction (Griffin and Taylor 2017; Isuster 2020; Sample and Schrum 2013; Tracy and Hoiem, 2018).</p>
            <p style=""text-align: left; "">In the context of a Hispanic Studies course, a librarian offered a workshop series on digital text analysis and the web-based reading and analysis environment Voyant Tools. Interspersed with instruction there were a series of low stakes assessments that helped students understand and apply the content of the workshops. Working with the class readings, the librarian created activities that did not rely on having a single answer but encouraged students to discuss and interrogate both the methods and the information used. For example, when preparing a text for text analysis, students debated how different research questions necessitate different text preparation. The activities were completed in groups and were not graded. Results were discussed within the class.</p>
            <p style=""text-align: left; "">The short paper presentation will explore the process of creating and implementing low stakes activities for digital text analysis and other digital humanities instruction. It will discuss the benefits of these types of activities as they pertain to digital humanities instruction and engagement and will share best practices and tips to help attendees create these kinds of activities in their own classrooms, including assignment design and sourcing materials.</p>

11900,2022 - Tokyo,Tokyo,Responding to Asian Diversity,2022-01-01T00:00:00Z,ADHO,ADHO,,Tokyo,,Japan,https://dh2022.adho.org/,Do we have to limit our research question by the tool to be used? The iLCM as an example of freely extensible research software for text-based research tasks in the humanities:,,Andreas Niekler;Christian Kahmann,poster / demo / art installation,"<text xmlns=""http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"" xml:lang=""en"">
        <body>
            <p>The barriers to our creativity are often the tools we have at our fingertips. This is particularly visible in text-oriented research tasks in the humanities, where a wide range of libraries and stand-alone software are available. The constraints of each tool and the researcher's skills in using the tools both shape and co-construct the research process. In our view, such influence should be minimized in the research process. The interactive Leipzig Corpus Miner (iLCM) [https://ilcm.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/] (Niekler et. al., 2018) represents a ready-to-use and GUI-supported software solution for the use of text mining in the humanities, cultural studies, and social sciences. The software is completely based on R [https://www.r-project.org/] and RShiny [https://shiny.rstudio.com/]. In parallel to the iLCM interface, an RStudio server [https://www.rstudio.com/] instance is provided as an IDE that ensures access to the available data and results. Among other things, the tool offers the pre-processing of multilingual documents, the retrieval and management of document collections, the deduplication of content, the analysis of word frequency, the analysis of word co-occurrence, time series analysis, topic models, the automatic coding and annotation of categories, supervised text classification (e.g. sentiment analysis) and more. In our poster, we demonstrate that its built-in ability to produce custom scripts, export results and script-based adaptations of the available analyses circumvents some restrictions of other tools used in humanities research. </p>
            <p>For researchers using text-oriented analysis methodologies, implementing their own analysis programs is often not a viable option. While more and more researchers in the humanities, cultural studies, and social sciences are acquiring programming skills, developing complex research software remains a complicated process that typically requires trained software developers. Instead, applied research relies on existing research software. There are many single, specific (i.e. for one purpose) ready-to-use tools, e.g. for topic modeling [e.g. https://dariah-de.github.io/TopicsExplorer/], concordance tools [e.g. https://voyant-tools.org/] or word scaling [e.g. http://www.wordfish.org]. This restricts researchers to narrow study designs that stay within the confines of the specific software which leads to a significant reduction in the method portfolio of a research project. If scholars want to map more complex (NLP) workflows it gets more difficult, because researchers often have to use full-blown frameworks or APIs [https://www.nltk.org/, https://spacy.io/, https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/, https://opennlp.apache.org/, https://quanteda.io/] which is a deterrent for many humanists. Digital humanities tools must therefore not only implement general best practices from the field of usability, but also need to address the special characteristics of users in the humanities (Burghardt and Wolff, 2014). There are isolated approaches of integrating the whole NLP-pipeline [https://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/, https://hudesktop.hucompute.org/, https://textgrid.de/]. Nevertheless, the limitations are that you can recombine the provided processes in the tools but not fundamentally extend them.</p>
            <p>We exemplify the benefits that result from the extensibility of the iLCM as follows:</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend=""bold"">Adaptability: </hi>Predefined analysis functions often require research-specific adaptations, both in preprocessing and in the analysis of text data. In the iLCM, a high degree of adaptability is provided by the ability to extensively parameterize each analysis step. Since internally each analysis method is implemented as a script written in the R programming language, it is possible to adapt the predefined methods directly. The edited processes can be reintegrated into the tool and are also available to the users of the graphical interface. In this way, iLCM can also be used to distribute tasks in interdisciplinary teams. A developer for the R components can adapt analyses for the humanities researchers and they use the processes via an easily accessible graphical interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                <hi rend=""bold"">Extensibility: </hi>If a needed function or method is not available in the iLCM, it should be possible to add these functions. In iLCM, new scripts can be created within the iLCM script editor to add new analysis functions or replace existing ones. Furthermore, it is possible to implement additional analyses based on intermediate results in an associated RStudio IDE.
            </p>
            <p>
                <hi rend=""bold"">Data export: </hi>If it is not possible or desired to fully implement a research design within the framework provided by the iLCM, it may still be possible to represent at least partial-processes using the tool. The result of these can then be exported and used in other software environments.
            </p>
            <p>With the iLCM we reflect the requirements of humanists for interactive, visual interfaces and standard tools. In response to frequently necessary adjustments in the creative processing of research tasks, we have also implemented the requirements of agile development in research processes. (Heyer, Kahmann and Kantner, 2019). With this Feature we contribute to the fact that the tool used does not limit the researchers and that the openest possible processing of text-oriented research tasks is possible.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Figure 1: The view shows the interface of the iLCM in which an editing interface for the scripts has been integrated. The example of a co-occurrence analysis shows that the underlying standard process, which can also be used via the graphical user interface, is customizable. The edited process can then be integrated again with a custom process name and is also usable for all users of the graphical interface.</p>

        <body>
            <p style=""text-align: left; "">Not all Humanities have been equally touched by the digital. For textual scholarship, history and linguistics, for instance, we can have a substantial number of scholarly contributions, particularly when we include experiences embodied in projects and resources. However, comparatively speaking, digital literary criticism has had few followers. An exception are Computational Literary Studies (CLS) that apply quantitative methods to large amount of literary and bibliometric data. Linked to the methods of distant reading [Moretti, 2005], this approach enjoys great success today, while web resources like Voyant, software like Gephi, and programming environments like R, have made text mining very accessible, even for those with limited computer skills. Linked to this approach, stylometry and authorship attribution are also thriving. Particularly mediatized researches are the initiatives that led to ""unmasking"" the identies of Robert Galbraith, a pseudonym of J.K. Rowling, and Elena Ferrante [Joula, 2015; Tuzzi and Cortelazzo, 2018]. However, literary criticism connected to close reading seems almost absent from the DH radar. The CATMA tool, designed to define personalized tagsets for (mainly) literary analysis [Meister 2020], represents a bright exception. Meister, in fact, is one of the few scholars that has engaged with digital literary criticism and digital hermeneutics; the latter has been explored also by Van Zundert (2016) and Ramsey (2011), but from a quantitative perspective. Relatively few scholars in DH have to addressed literary criticism with qualitative approaches, which are, conversely, among the most important for non-digital literary scholars.</p>
            <p style=""text-align: left; "">The reasons for this absence are probably to be found in the controversies about the use of markup within texts that have inflamed the scholarly community since the Eighties. The act of adding explicit markers in the text has been subjected to scrutiny, as it is perceived (rightly) as a harbinger of interpretation and this fact has been (and is, to a certain extent, still) perceived as an invasion, a disfigurement of the text; Cummings (2008) gives a vivid account of the debate and reflects on how it has limited the use of TEI for literary criticism. The argument goes that once the text is marked up, it cannot be reused by others because the interpretation added by the encoder would make it unusable. According to this vision, digital texts must be made available in their most neutral and objective form, and any form of annotation, including editorial, must be avoided. Sperberg-McQueen 1991 and Cummings 2008, amongst others, have tried to address the issue, and I have argued elsewhere on the hermeneutic fallacy of the category of objectivity [Pierazzo 2015]; but these methods remain far from impacting “the Humanities at large” and in particular the literary scholars [Meister 2020]. However, in order to contextualize this debate, one should go back to when this controversy was born. The urgency of those years was to put texts online, to create literary corpora for concordances and the study of word frequencies; at the time, digital acquisition of texts, the transformation of the printed into sequences of characters to be analyzed by computers (Machine Readable Form) was mostly done by hand, with an enormous expenditure of time and energy. The emphasis was therefore on making texts available and on the need of not repeating work. Researchers did not want to work with texts full of manually added codes which then had to be removed just as manually in order to reuse the texts.</p>
            <p style=""text-align: left; "">It is worth noting, though, how this discourse hides the concept of DH as a service: the goal was thought produce resources for others to do “real” research. This argument is not only dangerous, condemning DH to a mere service, but also wrong, as text, any text, can only be the result of the dialectical compromise between the source documents that contains it and scholars that interpret it (even when they “only” transcribe it), and therefore no text can ever be considered objectively neutral [Pierazzo, 2015]. Today conditions have changed: most literary texts are digitally available in many versions, not to mention the plethora of tools and methods to “get rid of” markup, therefore the objections do not stand in the same way.</p>
            <p style=""text-align: left; "">Another obstacle for the uptake of DH in literary studies is the conviction that close reading and critical interpretation only require a reader, a text, and a (printed) essay, and therefore computers, in this context, are useful as typewriters [Kirschenbaum, 2016]. Yet, the lack of experimentation and engagement of the scholarly community in DH for literary analysis does not allow for a clear assessment of the epistemological added value of using computers for one or few texts at a time. But shouldn’t be this the moment for rethinking Digital Literary Studies? Couldn’t we at least try to use markup, ontologies and other methods to understand a text, or answer questions about interpretation?</p>
            <p style=""text-align: left; "">The paper will present some experiences at the University of Tours using TEI markup for the history of ideas, and ontologies and databases for analysis of fictional entities (people and places). We have applied these methods to works by Boccaccio, the Vite by Vasari, and to a small corpus of librettos of the 17th century. These experiments are showing promising results, not only in literary terms, but also on a largely methodological perspective, with colleagues and researchers finding themselves challenged and enticed by DH heuristics.</p>
            <p style=""text-align: left; "">Conditions are ripe for experiences and discussions in order to evaluate the impact of DH in literary studies, particularly in the light of the advancements in HTR and other types of CLS that have the potentials of bringing a large amount of unknown and understudied texts into the literary arena. This could truly change our perspectives and understandings on literature, but we need to sharpen our hermeneutical tools first.</p>

            <p style=""text-align: left;"">This short paper introduces LEAF (the Linked Editorial Academic Framework virtual research environment), an enhanced and expanded collaborative editorial platform that supports a variety of digital scholarly projects through a pipeline of integrated tools for collaborative production and publication of scholarly and documentary collections. Funded through the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, LEAF aims to address the challenges that face many who undertake and maintain large-scale collaborative DH projects now: namely, the need to ensure that these projects can remain operational and available to editors and audiences over the long-haul. It is only by sharing physical, software, and human infrastructures across institutions that this can be accomplished. In so doing we can support scalability, interoperability, and preservation while allowing for dynamic, iterative, and collaborative editing, and therefore ensure that our materials, collections, and editions will remain viable and accessible. The LEAF team aims to do this by integrating best practices for text encoding, annotation, and metadata standards. This short paper will report on the development of LEAF and the functionalities that it will provide. </p>
            <p style=""text-align: left;"">The implementation, and dissemination of LEAF is built upon a collaboration to extend the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC) built by the Universities of Alberta and Guelph (Susan Brown) with Bucknell University (Diane Jakacki), and Newcastle University (James Cummings) as founding partners. This work enhances CWRC’s functionality through collaborative software development that will ultimately support multiple instances of the LEAF platform in Canada, the US, and the UK. At Bucknell, this work will inform the Liberal Arts Based Digital Edition Publishing Cooperative and the Bucknell Digital Press, funded by an Andrew W. Mellon Digital Publishing Cooperative Implementation grant that will support an expanding portfolio of peer-reviewed digital editions and edition clusters. </p>
            <p style=""text-align: left;"">
                <hi style=""font-size:12pt"" xml:space=""preserve"">The LEAF platform combines hardware, software, and personnel. LEAF is being built on a solid foundation in terms of its data models, core functionality, and code management, so that it is positioned for extension and long-term sustainability. The platform is based on the Islandora 8 framework, which combines Drupal 8 with a Fedora 5 repository for long-term preservation. The LEAF repository will customize and enhance Islandora to enable digital humanities workflows and publication needs. Enhancements include an innovative web-based editing tool that allows users to employ TEI XML along with Web Annotation and IIIF standards-compatible Linked Open Data annotations that enhance discoverability and interoperability. </hi>
            </p>
            <p style=""text-align: left;"">
                The founding LEAF institutions are collaborating to upgrade the existing CWRC environment and produce a fully modular platform that will also be hosted on Bucknell’s servers, further tested at Newcastle University, and offered as containerized open-source code freely available for download and installation by other institutions. In particular, LEAF will facilitate the production and publication of dynamic digital scholarly editions and collections, offering multilingual transcription, translation, and image markup. Entirely browser-based, its functionality includes an in-browser XML markup editor, XML rendering tools, built-in text and data visualization tools including the Voyant Tools suite and its Dynamic Table of Contexts Browser. Overall the LEAF platform will provide a sophisticated interface for digital editions in which the XML markup is leveraged for navigation and active reading, and enhanced with Linked Open Data.
